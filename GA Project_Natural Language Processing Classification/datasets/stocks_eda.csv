stocks,What's your thought on ICLN for long term?,"As the title says I'm really interested in your thought about this ETF? I don't see it (or other sustainable energy stocks/ETF's) mentioned here a lot. Maybe I'm not reading correctly. I see a lot of potential in etf's like these since I really think we're heading into a sustainable world. What's your take?

I've bought this etf for the first time when it was sitting at around 15. It's been decreasing since that point all the way to around 10 euro's. I kept averaging down until now at 10.XX. still buying more and hoping it's a good one for the long run! 

How much risk is there involved from your perspective?",1622018105,"What's your thought on ICLN for long term?As the title says I'm really interested in your thought about this ETF?

stocks,"Lithia Motors ($LAD), just killin' me in the middle of DD","I started looking at Lithia Motors ($LAD) in the past couple of weeks.  They're an automotive retailer here in the states with a Market Cap of $10.37b.  Their growth is in main accomplished through M&amp;A of other dealerships.  

* Downsides include: 
   * susceptibility to economic downturns, 
   * if interest rates climb it will make it harder for them to offer attractive financing,
   * 2020 supply chain shortages interrupting inventory,
   * High debt levels,
   * Competitive advantages, as I see them currently, are limited:
      * small pricing advantage over smaller competitors,
      * limited protection in certain markets where regulations or distributor arrangements keep their competitors out for certain vehicle brands.
* Fundamental Numbers:
   * Free Cash Flow - went positive for the last 4 years. They ended 2020 with $381m in FCF. 
      * CAGR on FCF from 2017 to 2020 equaled 86.4%.
   * From 2010 to 2020
      * Revenue grew from $2b to $13.1b (CAGR 20.5%).
      * BVPS CAGR was 24.7% (2020 BVPS of $111.83).
      * EPS CAGR was 43.7% (2020 EPS of $19.53).
      * ROE in 2020 was 25.6% (CAGR 19.2%)
   * Total Debt in 2020 was $4.175b
   * Long-term debt was $2.311b 
   * LT Debt to Earnings = 4.92

The last few numbers are very concerning to me.  That's a whole lot of debt they are carrying!  Combined with limited economic moats.... Hmmmm.  However, I did compare their 2020 numbers to Carmax, one of their biggest competitors.  Carmax had a whooping LT Debt/Earnings ratio of 20.7, revenue of roughly $19b, and EPS of $4.52.  Carmax's growth number were also much less overall.

Given their LT debt/Earnings was roughly 1/4 of a direct competitor's and their growth numbers were looking good to me, I was continuing to do some reading and research.  Then Lithia made a rather big announcement.  They're doing a new public offering of shares valued at $1b.  At the same time they announced a private offering of $800 million in senior notes (3.875%) that would be due 2029...  Nearly another billion in LT Debt?!?!?  ARRGGHHHHH!

Looking at their 2021 Q1 presentation, they do give target uses of capital, which at least shows they have a plan that they are willing to publish.  Those plans are as follows:    

* Internal Investment &amp; Modernization 25% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 17%) 
* Share Repurchases 5%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 11%) 
* Dividends 5% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 4%) 
* Acquisitions 65% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 68%) 

Their stated goal in the 2021 Q1 for acquisitions is an annual addition of $3-5 billion in revenues.  They also posted good numbers for Q1 YoY and compared to the previous quarter.  However, with the debt now I feel like the research rabbit hole has gotten a little deeper for me....

Eight months ago, I made my first ""call of calls"" on a blockbuster event amongst reverse mergers.  Eight months ago, I made the ""call of calls"" on what was then a different ticker, and what now belongs to Lordstown Motors (RIDE).

And indeed, RIDE went on to become the fourth of nine realized blockbuster events amongst reverse mergers.

Then came Workhorse's loss of the USPS contract.  That was nothing, as production could continue on the main EV product.  Lordstown Motors could still take on Ford and its F-150.

Then came the Hindenburg short report.  RIDE became the second of three realized blockbuster events shorted by Hindenburg.  Like, really?

Then came the announced production delays recently, most likely due to semiconductor shortages.  The commercial EV startup's chances against Ford got dashed big time.

Then came something bigger and more unfortunate for RIDE bagholders: Rivian is just another EV startup.  Ford is a typical Big Auto laggard in EVs.

Not so the Next Tesla.

stocks,"Between FMAGA, which company would you invest in?","I personally think all these companies: Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon are all really good companies. But, IF YOU HAD TO INVEST IN ONLY ONE OF THEM. Which one would you invest in and why? 

They’re all huge, still growing, and making a lot of money. I am invested in all of them. Wasn’t a fan of Facebook, still not, yet I can’t deny that from an investing perspective they are a strong company. While I thought Facebook was dying and just for moms and dads, they got Instagram which everyone my age loves and used. They monetized their offerings tremendously well. Every time I thought they’re on a down hill from social pressures, they shoot back up. 

Microsoft was my favorite holding. I love Nadella, I love his vision. He played a tremendous role into turning Microsoft around and into the company that it is today. Their cloud services are growing and I believe are second behind AWS. They have their productivity and business sector which is compromised of office. Office changed was pushed towards a subscription model, one with better profit-margins.  As and end user I’m not a fan of this, but to get through college I needed those subscriptions. Their personal computing segment has been growing with their surface line. While I personally have a surface pro, I don’t love it. Yet since I got it they have been updating their line and have been putting pressure on the competition. I’m also excited for their gaming division. Not only their Xbox but how they are offering a new gaming experience. While I believe it almost may be redundant to get an Xbox if you have a gaming pc, how they’re connecting players on Xbox and pc may be the better option long term (potentially). 

Apple has been making amazing iPhones. While they have not been revolutionary model to model, people love their ecosystem. That’s the biggest thing for me. People love iPhones. They love MacBooks. Show me a college white girl without a MacBook, good luck. They go better together than a college white girl and starbucks. Also they are expanding offerings in their ecosystem. Their offerings are very easy to use, simple yet not plain, and a premium product. This is a company that has been consistently delivering amazing products. 

Alphabet, I’m not really sure what they do. Googles search engine I’m not sure anyone will ever overtake them. They are consistently adapting and improving it. They a make ton of ad revenue not only from google but YouTube. The more we use their products, the more data they collect, the better they know us and can profit of us. They I love YouTube ads? No. Are they making a ton of money of us? Yes. Also, they have a big R&amp;D budget. That puts me at peace about their future, that they are eager to grow and not satisfied with that they have achieve. 

Amazon I believe of all companies has been spending the most on R&amp;D. Their AWS Is leading and growing. From my understanding Azure still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of product quality and offerings. In fact, I would love Amazon even without their online market place. I really love Amazon For their AWS. I believe it brings in most of their profit. 

I don’t believe any of these companies are perfect, some of their products I don’t like, some of their fundamentals I’m not a fan of; yet, overall I think each of these companies has a lot of strengths.

As we all know China is extremely populated and they definitely lover their bikes. They are much more affordable than cars. They are much less space. They are cheaper than gas and most importantly pretty much anyone, any age can use a bike! I tried to research as much as I could the exact number of bikes in China but I could not find that unfortunately. The 600 million estimate was as close I could find.

Most importantly we may be able to make an investment. EZGO is the Ebike and IPO’ed early on in January. The execution from the company has been amazing. However, the stock has come down a lot. The figures yesterday 5/24/2021 given by the CEO were 6 months thru March 31st of 2021 and did not even include some big deals. 

Let me go thru some important highlights and insights from the CEO:

**Revenue grew 224% to $16.8 Million from just $5.2 Million**

**Projected sales of 100,000 bikes in 2021 (Which was given February 17th)**

**Sales of the 2 wheel bicycles increased 50% to 23,000 units while the 3 wheel increased 600% to 11,000 units! Total of 34,000 units. (5/24/2021 The CEO gave this update and said sales have increased drastically and it expects rapid revenue growth)**

Their higher end bike sells for about $300 US dollars and travels 225 miles on a single charge. Most bikes are about $200 and have 150-200 Mile range. You can go to their website EZGOtech, I do not want to get banned by including links. The bikes look great!

At 100,000 bikes, could be more and 300 a bike we are looking at 30 million in sales………which is 100% growth again……. I believe that estimate is light!

Thoughts? Opinions?",1621995428,"1.5 Billion People in China, Estimated 600 Million Bikes, Now the Ebike, Stock Symbol EZGO 225 miles $275 US DollarsHello everyone. As we all know China is extremely populated and they definitely lover their bikes. They are much more affordable than cars. They are much less space. They are cheaper than gas and most importantly pretty much anyone, any age can use a bike! I tried to research as much as I could the exact number of bikes in China but I could not find that unfortunately. The 600 million estimate was as close I could find.

Most importantly we may be able to make an investment. EZGO is the Ebike and IPO’ed early on in January. The execution from the company has been amazing. However, the stock has come down a lot. The figures yesterday 5/24/2021 given by the CEO were 6 months thru March 31st of 2021 and did not even include some big deals. 

Let me go thru some important highlights and insights from the CEO:

**Revenue grew 224% to $16.8 Million from just $5.2 Million**

**Projected sales of 100,000 bikes in 2021 (Which was given February 17th)**

**Sales of the 2 wheel bicycles increased 50% to 23,000 units while the 3 wheel increased 600% to 11,000 units! Total of 34,000 units. (5/24/2021 The CEO gave this update and said sales have increased drastically and it expects rapid revenue growth)**

stocks,Teslas Explosive Growth,"I have heard all the bear and bull cases and I can't comprehend people not lining up to invest in Tesla.

It is more obvious now than it ever was prior that this company is about to explode.

Demand is high. They sell every car they can produce. They are expanding their production capacity and will have two new factories coming online later this year.

They are improving margins with new technology/manufacturing processes and economies of scale.

They are improving revenue by producing and selling more cars every quarter.

Significantly increased revenue with higher margins equals explosive growth for the stock once the PE ratio adjust.

stocks,Discovery + Warner Media from ATT means the stock is worth less? What gives? DISCA was $43 Premarket 5/17/2021 and closed at $30.66?? What?,"If there are thoughts both PROS and CONs regarding this mega deal please feel free to comment. I want all the minds on Reddit to try and make some sense out of this....

When this deal was announced May 17th DISCA and T were on fire. Premarket I was watching shares catch fire and go above $43 on DISCA. Later on during the day, I did decide to start trading it as it fell to $34. In my opinion close to $34-35 is a fair value for the stock without a deal!

DISCA now has 15 + million subscribers for their 4.99 service. Expectations were for 8. We all know the streaming is the wave. As we see also with Netflix and Disney there is enough for them all provided we have rich content. In the most recent report DISCA beat on top line and said that the streaming business added 4 million subs in just the last 2 months. This business is alot more profitable. Current bottom line is about 2.79 for the year, next year is about 3.25 without factoring in the rapid streaming and more profitable side of the business. This yields a PE ratio of this year near 11 and next year under 10! Doesn't that sound cheap for a large company that will grow sales between 10-15%?

This is all before the Warner Media deal.... So in my mind DISCA is worth 34-35.... On it's own its executing and turning the business around.....so now with Adult Swim, Boomerang, Cartoon Network, CNN, TBS, TNT, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, Turner Sports, HBO..... now its worth less?

I understand we won't be able to see the full details and synergies yet.... this deal may or may not even close! It will be at least 6 months out.... but in the mean time DISCA which has been delivering is getting crushed? This combines to be close to a 50 billion company...... Unfortunately, T paid over 85 billion, and there is still alot of debt. But please help me figure out how DISCA isnt worth at least 35..... 

Should we just can the deal and fight to stop the merger? Is that what the market is saying? That combining all that and maybe charging 14.99 for HBO and Discovery + and maybe having 100 million subscribers is not good?...... Do we see what it is doing for DISNEY? Just shaking my head here.

stocks,My big bet on Molson Coors Beverage Company ($TAP),"**$TAP**

I only make two or three ""high-conviction"" trades per year. When I trade, I go big with serious conviction. I want to tell you about my biggest trade ever - Molson Coors (3500 shares @ $55.44). I've also got a bunch of options that expire in October.

I am not a ""technical"" trader. Nor am I a ""fundamental"" trader. I'm a guy who follows Chris Camillo &amp; and the Dumb Money ""social arbitrage"" style of investing. Chris has over a decade of 60%+ annual returns. The goal in this style of investing is to find game-changing information about a company that Wall Street doesn't know, research it like crazy, put on a trade, and then wait suits on Wall Street to discover the information when the company announces quarterly results. When game changing information is discovered by the suits in New York, they buy like crazy and drive the price up.

If you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

**Background of the Trade:**

Molson Coors is an old company. They make the majority of their money off of cheap beer (e.g. Coors Light, Miller Lite, &amp; Miller High Life). For the last 4-5 years, their stock has sunk because cheap beer is losing market share to hard seltzers and higher margin specialty beers.

Truly &amp; White Claw took over the seltzer market which is growing quickly. FYI - hard seltzer's are way more profitable than beer.

The company got a new CEO who implemented a ""Revitalization Plan"" and is heavily investing in more profitable ""above premium"" beverages to make more money off of their huge distribution network. The important beverages include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer
* Zoa - Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnston's energy drink
* Vizzy Hard Seltzer

**Thesis of the Trade:**

Molson Coors has three huge winners on its hands ***and Wall Street has no idea***. Once Molson Coors starts reporting actual numbers from Topo Chico, Vizzy, &amp; Zoa at the end of this quarter they are going to crush all the analyst earnings estimates. This will lead to the big boys on Wall Street buying up TAP and driving up the price.

**Why Doesn't Wall Street Know Yet?:**

While the analysts certainly know that Molson Coors is distributing these beverages, they simply don't realize how big of a deal these drinks are. They don't know this because 1) the recent quarterly numbers do not reveal it, and 2) Wall Street doesn't pay attention to store checks, Google Trends, or the power of social media.

Let me explain:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer was released to the public on March 29, 2021. This preliminary launch was limited to nine select markets. Two days later, Molson Coors' Q1 ended.  **So, Wall Street doesn't have any actual numbers on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer yet**. I recommend that you listen to the Q1 call (April 29th). In the Q1 call, the CEO only talked briefly about getting unexpected market share in Texas with Topo Chico. However, based on the Dumb Money community channel checks (Check our our Discord group), stores in every market where it was released are selling Topo Chico HS like crazy. Topo Chico is selling as good (if not better) than Truly and White Claw. This is a huge deal. Moreover, Google Trends show people are searching ""topo chico hard seltzer"" more than ""truly hard seltzer"" and more than ""white claw hard seltzer."" That is amazing. And it was only released in NINE markets. It might be way bigger when it gets release to the rest of the country. Finally, #TopoChico is trending on TikTok and Instagram. Don't underestimate the power of social media.
* Zoa was released on February 24th (2/3's into Q1). Aannnddd, it's release was initially limited to online sales and select in-store sales. **Any numbers from Zoa were de-minimis in Q1 results**. They are expanding their distribution, and Dumb Money members are finding it in grocery stores now. Just spend a few minutes looking at the Rocks Instagram feed to see how hard he is pushing this drink. The branding is excellent and he has over 239m followers on Instagram and 15.2 million on Twitter. Google Trends show people are searching ""zoa energy drink"" just as much as ""monster energy drink"" and more than ""red bull energy drink."" Think about that for a second. A bran new energy drink is just as sought after as two established brans that own the market. Again, Don't underestimate the power of the Rock on social media.
* Last quarter Molson Coors had **two** **unexpected events that significantly reduced earnings**. 1). The Texas freeze shut down their biggest manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, for several days - impacting earnings. 2). They had a cybersecurity event that shut down production even further. Read/listen to the last earnings call to learn more about these two one-off events.
* Vizzy was launched in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Google Trends shows it starting to compete with Truly and White Claw. It is a ""healthier"" hard seltzer because it has vitamins (I guess). This competition came from only one variety pack. They just released a new lemonade version that is getting much higher reviews that competitors. Moreover, Dumb Money store checks show it is selling out in Canada.
* I expected the next two quarters are going to be gangbusters for the entire industry - lifting Molson Coors and all the other alcohol companies. Think about it. The vaccine is highly distributed finally. Summer is coming. So many people are going to have BBQ's, go to baseball games, go on vacations, and just let loose. And it is the summer of hard seltzerI don't think Wall Street understands how big pent-up demand is for having a good time. Alcohol is going to flow this summer unlike anytime we've ever seen before. TAP is the ultimate recovery play.
* From a fundamental analysis, TAP is highly undervalued in comparison to its competitors. Just take some time and look at $BUD, $SAM, $STZ and you'll see what I mean.

Anyway, I'm tired of typing now. That is my trade. I hope someone appreciates this write-up.

Three final things:

1. If you want to know more about Chris Camillo, YouTube his famous Bloomberg interview. Also, he was recently featured in a recent ""Unknown Market Wizards"" book by Jack Schwager. Oh, and he wrote his own book back in the day called ""Laughing at Wall Street."" It's a great read.

 It's a common mistake even experienced investors mistake. I've made it. I guarantee half the people on here who ridicule others for it, have done it. Millionaires have gone bankrupt through bad investments. It isn't just retail traders and lower/middle class who suffer from it. 

Like a lot of people, I used to say I never invest more than I can afford. I believed it because I wasn't looking at the whole of my financial situation and was ignoring major red flags. It's easy to tell yourself you aren't making such a ""rookie"" mistake while ignoring red flags.  If this might be you, consider simple signs you need to pullback:

- you are constantly watching price fluctuations and agonizing over dips. This happens because you can't afford to lose what you've put in which means you've put too much in. If you're losing too much time during your day watching stock prices and your job isn't a day trader than you need to lower your investment.

- panic selling at even a small loss. Nothing wrong with putting a stop loss in place but if you're putting one in for a small percent drop, chances are you're terrified of losing more than you can afford. Cut down your stake and you'll find you're able to weather the dips long term

- thinking about your investment as ""money you have"" to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it's OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head. 

Here are some tips I've learned along the way that might help some others:

1. Don't beat yourself up too much or lose too much sleep when you realize you're in a hole. Its fixable and with mitigation, you'll be able to climb back out.

2. DON'T double down and try to recoup losses by putting more money you can't afford in. 

3. If you've put in too much and lost a lot, hold past the dip and sell once the stock has recovered to a safe degree. It's extremely rare for a stock to do a permanent  downward slump. Panic selling at the bottom screws you more. If a 50% drop happens and you've lost faith in the stock, wait until it comes up 25% to sell. This obviously is difficult to predict and modular depending on the stock and loss but unless a company is rumored to be going under entirely, you can wait for the buoy.

4. Just because you aren't losing money doesn't mean you aren't over-investing. Even if you're seeing gains but you're living paycheck to paycheck, you are over-invested. Stocks aren't a substitute for a savings account or as a holding place for all your extra funds. Its easy to placate out of that thinking when the going is good but that's how people get royally screwed. Even if it hurts, sell what you need to in order to get right financially. You might see fewer gains but you'll sleep better st night 

5. Make a gated checkpoint system of what you invest. For example, 20% of your paycheck goes into savings. 30% of your monthly savings account goes into investments. Find a number thats safe for you.

6. Last but not least, always imagine your investment is a vacation. A lot of people say ""assume it's money down the drain,"" but I disagree with this from a psychological standpoint. If you're active in trading, it's hard to simply view the money as gone. Imagine you're planning a vacation and the money you're putting in is what you're spending. You obviously want a nice vacation but no one spends their life savings on a vacation (unless you're dying in which case go nuts). Some vacations end up being worth the money and some end up a disappointment, but you don't ruin your financial life by taking a vacation and buying stocks should be no different.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. Random post from a bored out of worker investor.",1621961755,"Investing more than you can afford...it happens.

 It's a common mistake even experienced investors mistake. I've made it. I guarantee half the people on here who ridicule others for it, have done it. Millionaires have gone bankrupt through bad investments. It isn't just retail traders and lower/middle class who suffer from it. 

Like a lot of people, I used to say I never invest more than I can afford. I believed it because I wasn't looking at the whole of my financial situation and was ignoring major red flags. It's easy to tell yourself you aren't making such a ""rookie"" mistake while ignoring red flags.  If this might be you, consider simple signs you need to pullback:

- you are constantly watching price fluctuations and agonizing over dips. This happens because you can't afford to lose what you've put in which means you've put too much in. If you're losing too much time during your day watching stock prices and your job isn't a day trader than you need to lower your investment.

- panic selling at even a small loss. Nothing wrong with putting a stop loss in place but if you're putting one in for a small percent drop, chances are you're terrified of losing more than you can afford. Cut down your stake and you'll find you're able to weather the dips long term

- thinking about your investment as ""money you have"" to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it's OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head. 

Here are some tips I've learned along the way that might help some others:

1. Don't beat yourself up too much or lose too much sleep when you realize you're in a hole. Its fixable and with mitigation, you'll be able to climb back out.

2. DON'T double down and try to recoup losses by putting more money you can't afford in. 

3. If you've put in too much and lost a lot, hold past the dip and sell once the stock has recovered to a safe degree. It's extremely rare for a stock to do a permanent  downward slump. Panic selling at the bottom screws you more. If a 50% drop happens and you've lost faith in the stock, wait until it comes up 25% to sell. This obviously is difficult to predict and modular depending on the stock and loss but unless a company is rumored to be going under entirely, you can wait for the buoy.

stocks,People who work for publicly listed company. Do you own shares of company you work for?,"Hi, I was just wondering what are people doing who work for listed companies. Would be cool to hear experience of other people.

I work for company that is part of large multinational conglomerate that owns many other companies in the same sector. Our parent company is listed on NYSE. However, it is considered low P/E and high dividend value stock that recently got quite expensive so I don't own any stocks of it. Also... knowing how things work from the inside... I actually don't really want to hold any shares of this company... At least not at the current price.

I work for company that is part of large multinational conglomerate that owns many other companies in the same sector. Our parent company is listed on NYSE. However, it is considered low P/E and high dividend value stock that recently got quite expensive so I don't own any stocks of it. Also... knowing how things work from the inside... I actually don't really want to hold any shares of this company... At least not at the current price.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&gt;  
&gt;Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.   
&gt;  
&gt; Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
&gt;  
&gt;NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
&gt;  
&gt;As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

This company is about 20% short, has 113 million in cash in the bank with just under 15 million in debt, has a market cap of 500 million. They have generated about 80 million over the past 2 quarters as well. We have a major catalyst still….people aren’t running to the gym. If you go to Nautilus.com you will still see everything is back ordered with 6-8 weeks estimated ship date. The accounts receivables shows near 90 million on orders.

Another major catalyst is Peloton. Peloton is losing money and making a lot of acquisitions, they have spent more than the $500 million (the cost of entire NLS which is profitable). If NLS crushes again, which they will! (The question is what traders do with the report) PTON should use their beefy valuation to make an acquisition which would be immediately accretive to earnings for PTON. PTON is losing money and NLS is making money hands over fists. 

**These are just some of the 1st Quarter 2021 and some 4th Quarter 2020 highlights.**

**1st Quarter of 2021 Net Sales Increased 120% to $206 million, the highest quarterly sales in company history Operating Income of $39.7 million is third-highest in company history EBITDA was $40.4 million compared to $2.3 million last year** 

**1st Quarter of 2021 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale securities were $113.2 million, an increase of $86.8 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $26.5 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Debt was $13.6 million compared to $28.4 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Fourth Quarter EBITDA improved by 578% to $40 million compared to same period last year**

**Fourth Quarter Operating Income of $41 million is the second highest since our founding in 1986**

**On a full year**

**Company Achieves Full Year Revenue Guidance by Growing Revenue 79% to $553 million**

**Full Year Operating Income was $78 million and Full Year EBITDA was $84 million (Wait a second at $17 this company trades at $525 million….isnt that just 7x PE)**

So let us recap some of this here. This company which sells BowFlex, Schwinn and other brands is growing 120%, is making serious cash, had the best sales quarter in the company’s history and trades basically near 6PE. This past quarter was the 2nd most profitable quarter in its history after the 4th quarter of 2020. This has pulled back from $30 about 4-5 months ago after 2 amazing reports. You will not find 120% growth in profitable stocks. I understand that eventually maybe 2-4 quarters down the road the growth will slow. But the company has forecast this quarter at 50%....I believe that is modest..

Also, PTON is going to lose about $200 million because of their treadmill fiasco. NLS doesn’t have a fiasco, if anything PTON should plug that issue and make a purchase. PTON with BOWFLEX! The possibilities…

If you go to Nautilus.com you will still see everything is back ordered with 6-8 weeks estimated ship date. The accounts receivables shows near 90 million on orders.

Another major catalyst is Peloton. Peloton is losing money and making a lot of acquisitions, they have spent more than the $500 million (the cost of entire NLS which is profitable). If NLS crushes again, which they will! (The question is what traders do with the report) PTON should use their beefy valuation to make an acquisition which would be immediately accretive to earnings for PTON. PTON is losing money and NLS is making money hands over fists. 

**These are just some of the 1st Quarter 2021 and some 4th Quarter 2020 highlights.**

**1st Quarter of 2021 Net Sales Increased 120% to $206 million, the highest quarterly sales in company history Operating Income of $39.7 million is third-highest in company history EBITDA was $40.4 million compared to $2.3 million last year** 

**1st Quarter of 2021 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale securities were $113.2 million, an increase of $86.8 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $26.5 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Debt was $13.6 million compared to $28.4 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Fourth Quarter EBITDA improved by 578% to $40 million compared to same period last year**

**Fourth Quarter Operating Income of $41 million is the second highest since our founding in 1986**

**On a full year**

**Company Achieves Full Year Revenue Guidance by Growing Revenue 79% to $553 million**

**Full Year Operating Income was $78 million and Full Year EBITDA was $84 million (Wait a second at $17 this company trades at $525 million….isnt that just 7x PE)**

So let us recap some of this here. This company which sells BowFlex, Schwinn and other brands is growing 120%, is making serious cash, had the best sales quarter in the company’s history and trades basically near 6PE. This past quarter was the 2nd most profitable quarter in its history after the 4th quarter of 2020. This has pulled back from $30 about 4-5 months ago after 2 amazing reports. You will not find 120% growth in profitable stocks. I understand that eventually maybe 2-4 quarters down the road the growth will slow. But the company has forecast this quarter at 50%....I believe that is modest..

Also, PTON is going to lose about $200 million because of their treadmill fiasco. NLS doesn’t have a fiasco, if anything PTON should plug that issue and make a purchase. PTON with BOWFLEX! The possibilities…

stocks,Looking for some advice on building a nest egg for the kids.,"So I have a investment account for my kids I've been tossing all birthday, Christmas, stimulus,and what not into it and then investing for the intentions of giving them the money at 18 to do whatever schooling, car, house, or whatever.  I currently have them in SCHD, DGRO , VYM, and QYLD.  Figured with the dividens it will help build more and then just sheer growth on top of that. Basically wanting this to be set and forget.  Figuring now though that a straight ETF without the direct dividens would be better especially given the long term as it's looking at 15 years+ before any withdrawals will happen.  I did toss some trailing stops on the stocks minus QYLD at 15% so if the market does have a major drop like when covid hit it will exit before losing significant value.

I strongly believe RKT was the culprit. Famous for being short as high as 35% just a quarter ago. I believe the sharks were still nearby and ready. The short % has not been updated since earnings and is at 7%. I believe the new short is once again at 20% or above. The very next day following earnings the rest of the sector has been attacked.

stocks,Virgin Galactic II.,"Initially, I wanted to come into this post completely unbiased, I wanted to present the bull and bear case and give you a complete overview of sentiment and questioning from both camps, but I couldn’t help myself. Let me say it out loud, SPCE has an argument to make, I’m here to answer the 3 harshest criticisms that I have heard from the easiest to most difficult. No company or stock out there is a guarantee, I am not here to sell SPCE, it is still high risk as before, but that’s the nature of space exploration isn’t it…

Critique #1 - Revenue:  The company has millions in cash, enough to continue burning for 2 years. They plan to generate income via paying customers, astronaut training, low orbit cargo/experiment carry assignments, transportation offerings, and more. If this company doesn’t see future earning possible, why would they move forward to build more ships? Why would they hire more staff? Why would there be 3+ other companies wanting to eat into their market share?? 

Critique #2 - The Competition: “SpaceX and Blue Origin are going to eat the market, leaving SPCE with zero-to-little gains.”

 \#Debunked:  Let’s start with the elephant in the room, SpaceX, Elon Musk and SpaceX have touched on space tourism and presented concepts for how to use SN for high-speed point to point travel, getting anyone from NYC to Shanghai in 4 hours, that sounds wonderful at first but let me tell you 3 points on why this is out of touch. 1. Have you heard the noise created by a SN ship? Do you think that could take off near or within NYC and all its resident would be fine with a bomb like take off? This means they cannot be anywhere near a major city… 2 When will you get on a rocket heading for outer space with just a T-shirt and flip flops? When you get into space launch, you must train to do this, you must wear an astronaut suit, the concept of just passing through security and into your flight seat as a casual experience is unfathomable for the next few years, it’s not going to happen, flights from NYC to Paris cannot happen within minimal hours without so many other factors getting in the way of that time convenience...not in a rocket at least. #3 What is the main objective of SpaceX? Definitely not a relatively small market like space tourism, SpaceX is dealing with developing a system of launch logistics that rival shipping and train systems, they have been assigned to provide a lunar lander, they have the opportunity to secure the largest and most lucrative of satellite launches, and they have tight deadlines if they want to deliver the promise of making humans live on Mars, there is so much more and simply far too important of assignments that SpaceX has in front of it to pivot and go after a smaller market segment like fun filled space tourism. Now let’s talk about Blue Origin, this is VGs biggest rival as of today, but BO is clearing behind SPCE. BO was started with the purpose of getting to the moon and making humans multi-planetary via space hotels, this vision has faded off as of late. BO was in competition with SpaceX for lunar missions and lost coveted contracts to SpaceX, the only reason why BO is in space tourism is because it could meet its original goals, it’s now pivoting out of necessity, a company mission statement is important, and BO is confused and lost. The experience that they are offing is lesser than what SPCE is proposing, their ergonomics, standard up and down flight experience, the aesthetics of the ship interior and exterior are all subpar in comparison to SPCE. They don’t have an airport to take off from…I could go on all day. VG is founded by Richard Branson, a man with a lifelong experience in hospitality, entertainment, and travel markets, BO is founded by a man who found the cheapest way to ship boxes and cancel mom and pop stores forever, if you pay any attention to the staff of a company before you invest, VG is a no brainer. VG has a CEO and upper level staff with experience in Disney, BO has upper management with experience in mechanical systems….are you noticing a pattern?….

Critique #3 - Death:  I’ve read the comments “this is a disaster waiting to happen”, “they will get canceled when thy kill somebody”….for the record, this is a great critique and justified concern, death of a client would be both heartbreaking for VG and a setback. To answer this we must look no further than other transportation and extreme entertainment industries. Let me ask you, has anyone died on a plane, in a car crash, a motorcycle, perhaps skydiving?...certainly if a death occurs on an SPCE flight due to a crash.

.....

I do not have a crystal ball, I do not offer financial advice. I just wanted to share because I hear the arguments over and over, anyone out there who is taking interest, now you know, SPCE is real. This company is a retail favorite, love it or hate it, we are all unable to look away… in an era of pent-up travel demand, the roaring twenties can only be ushered in by something as lavish as SPCE, whatever your take, wish them luck.

GameStop (GME) closed the most recent trading day at $180.01, moving +1.82% from the previous trading session. This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.99%.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the video game retailer had gained 16.94% over the past month. This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 3.17% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.26% in that time.

Investors will be hoping for strength from GME as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of -$0.56, up 65.22% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.17 billion, up 14.63% from the year-ago period.

GME's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of -$0.63 per share and revenue of $5.63 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +70.56% and +10.69%, respectively.

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for GME. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 13.15% higher. GME is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Retail - Consumer Electronics industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 124, putting it in the top 49% of all 250+ industries.

2 Key Things From 3D Systems' Earnings Call That Investors Should Know | NASDAQ

Earlier this month, 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD reported first-quarter 2021 results that easily beat the Wall Street consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. The stock skyrocketed 35% the next day.

In the first quarter, the 3D printing company's revenue rose 7.7% year over year (and 17% excluding the impact of divestitures to $146.1 million. Growth was driven by continued strength in the healthcare segment and a stabilizing of the industrial segment, which was hard hit by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.


Moreover, the company posted a profit on both an adjusted basis and according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted for one-time items, net income landed at $20.9 million, or $0.17 per share, up from a loss per share of $4.5 million, or $0.04 per share, in the year-ago period. GAAP net income was $45.2 million, or $0.36 per share, up from a loss of $18.9 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2020.

Earnings releases tell only part of the story. Following are two key things from 3D Systems' Q1 earnings call that investors should know.

1. The company's competitive advantages
From CEO Jeffrey Graves' remarks:

There are three things that inspire my confidence in our future. And I believe they should inspire yours as well. First, we clearly by far have the broadest technology portfolio in the industry. [...] Second, I'm convinced that we have the brightest and most creative application engineers in the industry. [...]

Third, as one of the largest and most experienced companies in the industry, we have the scale and the infrastructure to not only support our customers' needs when they initially implement additive manufacturing, but also sustain them over the lifetime of their equipment by providing key services and consumables that are vital to their ongoing business success.

As to Graves' first point, 3D Systems does have the broadest offerings in the 3D printing industry in terms of technology to my knowledge, at least among publicly traded companies. It has several polymer technologies and at least one metal 3D printing technology.

For a couple of points of comparison: Rival Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS, another well-established pure-play 3D printing company, doesn't have a metal 3D printing technology. Newly public Desktop Metal (NYSE: DM is just in the early stages of commercializing its metal technology and only recently expanded into polymers via its February acquisition of EnvisionTEC.

His second point about having ""the brightest and most creative application engineers"" is too subjective to address.

I'll also agree with Graves' third point about 3D Systems having a scale and experience advantage, at least relative to most other players. That said, there's a caveat here. Under the prior two CEOs, the company prematurely released products that had quality issues. So, while scale does usually provide various advantages, it won't do so if customers are hesitant to buy a product from a company due to concerns about quality. Hopefully, this issue is largely behind 3D Systems, but investors still need to keep an eye on it.

2. Ramping up its healthcare business organically and through acquisitions
From Graves' remarks:

As you can see in our numbers for Q1, we're seeing rising demand for new applications, particularly in our healthcare business. To meet this demand forecast, we're expanding our Denver, Colorado, location by roughly 50%. [...] Through this next phase of investment [...] we'll be able to reduce time to market for new medical applications, continue expanding our product offerings, and better support the holistic needs of our growing healthcare customer base.

In Q1, 3D Systems' healthcare revenue surged 39% year over year to $72.5 million. This segment accounted for 49.6% of the company's total revenue of $146.1 million. So its business is now essentially evenly split between healthcare and industrial.

As Graves said on the prior quarter's call, the company's healthcare business ""brings a bit higher gross margin on average than our industrial business."" So, naturally, it makes great sense to focus somewhat more on applications that are more profitable.

In addition, 3D Systems announced several days before it released its Q1 results that it had acquired Allevi, a small Philadelphia-based bioprinting company. Bioprinting refers to using 3D printing technology to print animal and human cells to produce three-dimensional, functional tissues. This was a smart move and expands the company's involvement in this space, as it's been collaborating with United Therapeutics (NASDAQ: UTHR in this realm since 2017.

Graves said one key intermediate-term application of bioprinting is to help pharmaceutical companies speed up the drug development process. A longer-term goal of those working in this space is to print fully functional solid human organs such as the liver, heart, and kidneys for transplant purposes. Regenerative medicine, as it's often called, is in its infancy, but it has humongous growth potential.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 24, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 24, 2021**

After weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. 

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

Moreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, it’s important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Fed’s targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

Michael Jones, CEO of Caravel Concepts said, “I do think it's been a pretty healthy sideways chop. It's taken out some of the speculative excess. The biggest pullbacks have been in some of the most pricey names. That all feels very healthy to me.”

**Highlights**

* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* Investors have rejected a record number of executive compensation plans in non-binding votes of U.S.-listed companies this year, objecting to pay rises and the easing of performance targets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by consulting firm ISS Corporate Solutions. I hope this trend continues moving forward and urge shareholders to continue voting no on potential compensation plans. A record 14 S&amp;P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject executive pay packages so far this year.

First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. 

For the valuation: 

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple´s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. 

Because Apple´s price is higher right now, I don´t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.

Where I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. 

What I´ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. 

Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.",1621884208,"Apple Stock Analysis: Is AAPL a good buy?Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here.

stocks,Can someone explain the inflation worry when the banks have excess liquidity?,"If banks have an excess amount of liquidity and the fed is trying to get people to spend money, why would the fed raise interest rates and make it more beneficial for people to hold onto their money? To me it only makes sense to drop interest rates to the negatives so people are forced to spend money or lose it. People aren’t going to spend money when commodity prices are high, so deflation would also prove to be beneficial for the economy IMO.        

How does increased interest rates cause more spending when all it does is cause commodities to go up and force more people to spend significantly less? Negative interest rates are also something that will boost retail growth as retail businesses will be able to borrow money at a negative rate and pay their employees a higher wage to get their business started/back running.

[Smart Mirror Product Action Shot](https://imgur.com/a/ZNJri3r)

$CAPC is a debt-free penny stock exempt company currently trading on the higher-tier OTCQB markets with audited financials and fully SEC reporting.

During last week's conference call, CEO confirmed that Smart Mirrors will begin shipping in June on Capstone's website and **will be available on Amazon.** The company confirmed that the Smart Mirror will be in big box retailers in second half of 2021. Capstone products currently sell in major retailers like Costco, Home Depot, Walmart, Target and more. It's amazon reviews for it's previous products are 5-stars. They know how to build a quality product that sells.

[Tweet from Capstone Companies, Inc.](https://twitter.com/CAPC_Capstone/status/1395793359697031174)

The number of outstanding shares is just under 50M with the company directors owning nearly half of the shares, leaving a float of 24M. Directors have never sold a share over company's history - zero dilution. In fact they added 400K worth of shares in the last couple of months in the open market with plans to buy another 750K shares through August. This company believes in the product.

This will easily appreciate in value once revenues from Smart Mirror are realized. This company is primed for growth and the corporation is already preparing for possible uplisting to NASDAQ.

Beyond this, the Smart Mirrors are just cool - people want them and the price point for $CAPC mirrors is huge for what it offers. Only $699 starting price means it is affordable for the average person, and you can mirror your phone and engage with the mirror just like you would a tablet or touch-screen PC. I think this product blows $LULU mirror out of the water as far as functionality and price point.

Only $699 starting price means it is affordable for the average person, and you can mirror your phone and engage with the mirror just like you would a tablet or touch-screen PC. I think this product blows $LULU mirror out of the water as far as functionality and price point.

$CAPC should have no problem selling Smart Mirrors direct to consumers, but also in acquiring contracts with hospitality providers, restaurant bathrooms and high-end developments",2721,89,2632

I only play a low risk game with the top 10 companies in the SPY500 and the ETF indexes of SPY500, (VOO, VOOG) and sometimes QQQ. I never look beyond these companies because even if one day the market crashes one day while I am invested, basically I will be locked in for long term investments in the American economy and some companies I believe in and would love to work for in the future. 

Anyway I like this 1-2 day game when I buy stocks at the dip and sell them (Like today). I use a bunch of indicators to predict red days and dips. It does not work perfectly but works sometimes.

stocks,Lilium to establish airline operations in Europe,"Lilium announces that Luxaviation Group plans to support Lilium in building out airline operations in Europe.

### Media Release

**Munich, May 20, 2021:** Lilium GmbH (“Lilium”), positioned to be a global leader in regional electric air mobility with the development of its electric vertical take-off and landing jet (“Lilium Jet”), and Luxembourg-based Luxaviation Group, one of the largest business aircraft and helicopter operators worldwide, today announced that Luxaviation Group plans to support Lilium in building out airline operations in Europe.

Lilium’s vision for a flexible transportation ecosystem is supported by world-class partners. Luxaviation Group brings over 60 years of experience operating passenger service with hundreds of aircraft under management and 10 Air Operator Certificates (“AOCs”) across Europe.

Building on Luxaviation Group's track record, which includes securing the first European Union Aviation Safety Agency AOC approval for a business jet operator, the parties anticipate Luxaviation Group will become responsible for parts of the airline operations being developed by Lilium. This includes securing necessary approvals and managing pilots, which will be trained following a type rating concept developed by Lufthansa Aviation Training, another Lilium partner. As Lilium continues developing its launch networks in Europe for the planned commercial launch in 2024, Luxaviation Group will also work with Lilium on the development of its best-in-class customer experience, built around Lilium’s digital airline platform and the 7-Seater Lilium Jet.

“We are proud to be working alongside Luxaviation Group, a leading operator in the aviation sector with a track record in offering an innovative and customer-focused service, to build out the Lilium network in Europe. This marks a key milestone as we prepare for launch, and we look forward to working together to provide an exceptional airline service for our passengers,” explains Remo Gerber, Chief Operating Officer at Lilium.

Patrick Hansen, Group CEO at Luxaviation Group said: “Electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft will fundamentally change the way we travel, and the Lilium network is poised to be at the forefront of this sea change in aviation”. Christophe Lapierre, Head of Strategy of Luxaviation Group adds: “We are very pleased to have been selected by Lilium to be their partner in aircraft operations. As an early believer in advanced air mobility, we look forward to bringing our experience and credentials to the partnership with Lilium and building out a service that will truly feel like a first of its kind.”

Lilium has previously announced plans for launch networks in Germany through partnerships with Munich, Nuremberg, Dusseldorf, and Cologne/Bonn airports.

stocks,Are airlines undervalued? My analysis,"Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, less than half a percent of AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",1621830021,"Are airlines undervalued?

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, less than half a percent of AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on.",5441,37,5404

\- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.22. Here's an [investopedia link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) for those of you that can read

\- Profit-Loss ratio of 3.48.

\- Avg win of 0.85%

\- Avg loss of -0.24%. The fact that this number's absolute value is lower than average win is a good thing

Right now I'm up 44% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13%.

&amp;#x200B;

Some stats (and a picture of the returns):

\[[https://i.imgur.com/hqigfrX.png](https://i.imgur.com/hqigfrX.png)\]([https://i.imgur.com/hqigfrX.png](https://i.imgur.com/hqigfrX.png))

&amp;#x200B;

\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an **annualized return of 26%** (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- **Max drawdown** of -8.7% (thought this was pretty interesting - W\*B would be a very cool hedge for financial markets at large. Rode COVID like a wave)

\- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.22. Here's an [investopedia link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) for those of you that can read

\- Profit-Loss ratio of 3.48.

\- Avg win of 0.85%

\- Avg loss of -0.24%. The fact that this number's absolute value is lower than average win is a good thing

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, invested around $60k in January myself, I'm at around $90k rn. Not one of my main investment vehicles, and maybe not the smartest investment, but I make myself feel better by telling myself it's smarter than Y\*LOing on puts.

In simple terms Enthusiast Gaming is company that aims to create massive gaming media network that then could be monetized by advertising, subscriptions, merchandise and content licensing. As such, its not not video games developer or publisher. It is more similar to advertising conglomerates like IPG, WPP or Omnicom who own many smaller agency businesses.

Currently, the company owns over 100 websites focusing on unique gaming  content (Destructoid, The escapist, Nintendo Enthusiasts, etc), YouTube channels with a combined 24 million+ subscribers (Wisecrack, The Squad, The Count Down, etc),  professional Esports teams such as Luminosity Gaming, influencers across  many different social media platforms, and it was responsible for  hosting live Esports events pre-COVID 19. Taken together, its platforms reach an audience of over 300 million gamers on a monthly basis. Enthusiast's esports subsidiary Luminosity Gaming owns teams  competing in Fortnite, Apex Legends, and a variety of other games. The  company helps Enthusiast get access to its own esports content and gain a  foothold in the $1 bil+ esports market.

65 million of the 300 million monthly users are located in the U.S.  alone. This is important because when it comes to eventual monetization,  U.S. “eyes” are traditionally those that have the highest value. Half of every American male between the age of 18 and 34 visited at least one of the platforms owned by Enthusiast Gaming. This is an important  demographic, since it is one of the hardest-to-reach ones, and is one  the demographics that spends the most on non-essential goods and has a  larger lifetime value, since they are in the early stages of their  lives. The CEO mentions how 70% of the company's audience is either Gen Z or Millennials, with 65% of its audience spending more than 15  hours a week gaming. 67% of its platform users purchase more than 7 video games every year. Referring back to the importance of this demographic because it is hard to reach; an astounding 48% of Enthusiast Gaming’s audience do not use Facebook. Altogether, the company has amassed an  audience with significant potential for monetization if it is able to  execute on its strategies over the coming years.

Today, Enthusiast  has 110k+ subscribers, mostly from The Sim's Resource, and this number is up 50% YTD, generating slightly less than $2mil in revenue per  quarter. While management has rolled out subscriptions across a few individual  properties like The Sims Resource, Escapist, and Siliconera, they are  working on putting together an integrated subscription that takes  advantage of their ownership across all these properties.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There’s a much bigger play that we can offer customers, and we are  spending a lot of time figuring out how to nail it. That’s our approach,  because nobody can offer, the things that we can offer. And so, we  think our best chance for transformative penetration and transformative  growth on the subscription side is an integrated offer.

&amp;#x200B;

As one of the largest content creators in the gaming industry, with ownership of multiple YouTube  channels as well as esports team, it's only natural that Enthusiast  would enter the content licensing space. In the future, esports and  gaming content will replace a good chunk of sports and other content  available on OTT services today, in my opinion, as 60% of Gen Z people  prefer esports over traditional sports. Today, Enthusiast has already licensed out their BCC Gaming content to Samsung's OTT service, and there should be more deals done in the next few years.

After all these monetization streams, Enthusiast is also planning to  monetize through e-commerce and social networking. However, since this  is still several years out, management has not given much detail on  this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And then, down the road, we have more focus on ecommerce and creating  a marketplace, as well as developing a social network, which we’re  pretty excited about.

In addition, recently acquired Omnia Media is a keystone in the YouTube  ecosystem, providing services to over 500 influencers, including  well-known influencers with millions of subscribers. Omnia Media also  owns its own YouTube channels like Wisecrack and BCC Gaming that produce original content.

Overall, gaming is  going to continue its strong growth and Enthusiast is well-positioned to  capitalize on this trend by helping to connect gamers around the world.  In addition, the company is expected to show strong growth over the  next few years yet its valuation is low compared to other gaming  leaders.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;Gaming has eclipsed movies, music and books.

&amp;#x200B;

In simple terms Enthusiast Gaming is company that aims to create massive gaming media network that then could be monetized by advertising, subscriptions, merchandise and content licensing. As such, its not not video games developer or publisher. It is more similar to advertising conglomerates like IPG, WPP or Omnicom who own many smaller agency businesses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[https://postimg.cc/hzQgfHm2](https://postimg.cc/hzQgfHm2)  
&gt;  
&gt;Image visualizing Enthusiast Gaming overall structure.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, the company owns over 100 websites focusing on unique gaming  content (Destructoid, The escapist, Nintendo Enthusiasts, etc), YouTube channels with a combined 24 million+ subscribers (Wisecrack, The Squad, The Count Down, etc),  professional Esports teams such as Luminosity Gaming, influencers across  many different social media platforms, and it was responsible for  hosting live Esports events pre-COVID 19. Taken together, its platforms reach an audience of over 300 million gamers on a monthly basis. Enthusiast's esports subsidiary Luminosity Gaming owns teams  competing in Fortnite, Apex Legends, and a variety of other games. The  company helps Enthusiast get access to its own esports content and gain a  foothold in the $1 bil+ esports market.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Slide showcasing owned assets

&amp;#x200B;

65 million of the 300 million monthly users are located in the U.S.  alone. This is important because when it comes to eventual monetization,  U.S. “eyes” are traditionally those that have the highest value. Half of every American male between the age of 18 and 34 visited at least one of the platforms owned by Enthusiast Gaming. This is an important  demographic, since it is one of the hardest-to-reach ones, and is one  the demographics that spends the most on non-essential goods and has a  larger lifetime value, since they are in the early stages of their  lives. The CEO mentions how 70% of the company's audience is either Gen Z or Millennials, with 65% of its audience spending more than 15  hours a week gaming. 67% of its platform users purchase more than 7 video games every year. Referring back to the importance of this demographic because it is hard to reach; an astounding 48% of Enthusiast Gaming’s audience do not use Facebook. Altogether, the company has amassed an  audience with significant potential for monetization if it is able to  execute on its strategies over the coming years.

Today, Enthusiast  has 110k+ subscribers, mostly from The Sim's Resource, and this number is up 50% YTD, generating slightly less than $2mil in revenue per  quarter. While management has rolled out subscriptions across a few individual  properties like The Sims Resource, Escapist, and Siliconera, they are  working on putting together an integrated subscription that takes  advantage of their ownership across all these properties.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There’s a much bigger play that we can offer customers, and we are  spending a lot of time figuring out how to nail it. That’s our approach,  because nobody can offer, the things that we can offer. And so, we  think our best chance for transformative penetration and transformative  growth on the subscription side is an integrated offer.

&amp;#x200B;

As one of the largest content creators in the gaming industry, with ownership of multiple YouTube  channels as well as esports team, it's only natural that Enthusiast  would enter the content licensing space. In the future, esports and  gaming content will replace a good chunk of sports and other content  available on OTT services today, in my opinion, as 60% of Gen Z people  prefer esports over traditional sports. Today, Enthusiast has already licensed out their BCC Gaming content to Samsung's OTT service, and there should be more deals done in the next few years.

After all these monetization streams, Enthusiast is also planning to  monetize through e-commerce and social networking. However, since this  is still several years out, management has not given much detail on  this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And then, down the road, we have more focus on ecommerce and creating  a marketplace, as well as developing a social network, which we’re  pretty excited about.

&gt;Company's growth and monetization strategy

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, recently acquired Omnia Media is a keystone in the YouTube  ecosystem, providing services to over 500 influencers, including  well-known influencers with millions of subscribers. Omnia Media also  owns its own YouTube channels like Wisecrack and BCC Gaming that produce original content.

Overall, gaming is  going to continue its strong growth and Enthusiast is well-positioned to  capitalize on this trend by helping to connect gamers around the world.  In addition, the company is expected to show strong growth over the  next few years yet its valuation is low compared to other gaming  leaders.

stocks,Estate/Inheritance tax on US or UK stocks for a foreigner,"Hey guys, I really appreciate you taking the time to read my post and help me. I hope you can bear with me through my inexperience and confusion

I am from Serbia, living here completely as a tax resident. With that in mind, I realized that my personal investments in US stocks will be liable to a 60% tax upon death (inheritance to my kids)

According to this [irs post](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/some-nonresidents-with-us-assets-must-file-estate-tax-returns) ,  Certain deceased nonresidents who were not citizens of the United States are subject to U.S. estate taxation with respect to their U.S.-situated assets. They also list stock of corporations under us law as an example of something that would fall under us law.

Am I wrong to say that I (my kids) will be liable for a high US estate tax and talking to the IRS upon death?

With that, I have a follow up question, and that is, how do these rules apply to me buying UK stocks. Here, I have not found any posts that specifically reference non citizen, non residents. The closest to that I found was this [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/selling-or-inheriting-assets) which says that you only pay inheritance tax on land, but then also on the same page says shares could also be liable for the tax???

stocks,"Cruise stock holders, when are you selling?","I bought CCL/CUK (Carnival Corp) starting late April last year and made it 100% of my portfolio. Now it is up around 100% (mostly long term gains) and I recently reflected if my hypothesis for the stock was seen through.

Frankly I did not expect to hold so long. I bought expecting a faster return to normal and if I knew in advance they wouldn't sail in the US until July 2021 I would assume it would be a bad investment. 

However, now they are confirmed to sail in July. I guess the hype that is left would be the cruises actually sailing successfully, and then the announcement of what they will do with their reserve cash ($11.5 billion compared to their usual $1 billion or less). They have around $26 billion in long-term debt (compared to $9 billion before the coronavirus) so I imagine it is a priority to pay off that. Then there are expenses of getting the cruises prepared to sail and upkeep. 

So even if CCL were to pay off $10 billion (maybe not the best use of funds) of their debt they would still be $6 billion more in debt than before the coronavirus with their dividend gone and shares heavily diluted.

In fact, their market cap is practically the same as it was pre-covid. In December 2019 they had a run up but the market cap now is actually higher than it was in November 2019. It would require billions in stock buybacks for the share price to rise to it's pre-covid levels (which included a dividend), on top of the billions needed to pay for debt/upkeep. Not to mention CCL was actually in a downtrend from 2018 on, with the market cap going from $50 billion to $30 billion.

So why would I hold now? Even if they have a successful year I'm having trouble justifying why they would continue to grow and outpace the SPY.

stocks,"Increased ""competition"" in the EV space is bullish news for TSLA, not bearish","#Disclaimer! I'm not saying i'm bullish (or bearish) on TSLA, just that this particular argument is weak.

Many TSLA bears point out the risk of increased competition resulting from companies moving into the EV space, especially since nearly all major makes now have an EV either in production or in development. 

For one, most of these cars target a completely different customer. Simply, cars like the Nissan Leaf or Chevy Bolt aren't cutting into Tesla sales just like the Toyota Corolla isn't cutting into BMW 330i sales. While it's true that ""better"" or more luxury lines like the Audi E-Tron are coming out, they're still not quite there in terms of competitive features and price point. It's reasonable to think many customers who are buying a $70k car are willing to spending another $10k for significantly better range, a bigger battery, better charging infrastructure, falcon wing doors, etc. Think about it, how many Model Xs do you see on the road versus an Audi E-Tron or Jaguar I-PACE? Yes, those cars newer, but there are other reasons for their dismal sales too. So while there's going to be *some* buyers choosing these new EVs over a Tesla, it's not the doom and gloom that Tesla bears seem to think. IMO, The competition between EVs versus ICEs is much more significant than the competition between EVs.

Lastly and most importantly, this increase in ""competition"" just draw more attention to the EV market in general, which will always be good for Tesla and this is why Musk has always pushed for more competition in the EV space. For instance, if we take the current EV market to have a relative ""size"" or value of 1 and Tesla owns 90% of it, that's a size or value of 0.9 for Tesla. But if this competition and attention causes the EV market to grow to 3 but Tesla only owns 40% of it, that's still a size of 1.2 for Tesla.",1621786549,"Increased ""competition"" in the EV space is bullish news for TSLA, not bearish#Disclaimer!

stocks,CHLORINE IS THE NEW GOLD TENDIE MAKER. HERE'S WHY. $OLN,"  

While we have all heard of the chlorine shortage, I am convinced we have incorrectly concluded the cause for the shortage. It is my belief that as a result of COVID overwhelming the entire healthcare industry (especially hospitals), the product that healthcare relies on most (chlorine and chlor alkali) became overwhelmed as a result. The true cause of this shortage is simply the effect of the overwhelming strain this pandemic placed on the entire healthcare industry. Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry.   

#### [Chlorine: On the ""Front Line"" in Hospitals® (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Chlorine/Front-Line/)  

#### Chlorine and Life-Saving Drugs 

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&amp;#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis &amp; Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&amp;#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis &amp; Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

stocks,TellurianLNG ready to support this cooperation 🇺🇸 + 🇰🇷with #USLNG from Driftwood $TELL #LNG,"Just last Friday, May 14th, Tellurian CEO Octávio Simões was Appointed Chairman of the U.S. Chamber’s U.S.-Korea Business Council. On Friday, May 21st, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with President Biden where steps were taken to reinforce economic cooperation between the two countries. Tellurian quoted the tweet stating “TellurianLNG ready to support this cooperation 🇺🇸 + 🇰🇷with #USLNG from Driftwood $TELL #LNG”.

This tweet may be a tease but we all know what they’re trying to tell us. South Korea was the top country for US LNG exports in September 2020!

What is Tellurian?

Tellurian was founded in 2016 by two industry icons, Charif Souki and Martin Houston. Charif set in motion the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the United States Lower 48 and founded Cheniere Energy. Martin originated the concept of LNG destination flexibility, ensuring that LNG became a commodity. 

Tellurian is currently a debt-free company!

What is LNG?

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non-pressurized storage or transport. It takes up about 1/600th of the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state. LNG is odorless, colorless, non-toxic, and non-corrosive.

When LNG is returned to its gaseous state, it is used across the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors for purposes as diverse as heating, cooking, generating electricity, and manufacturing a wide variety of products. LNG is also used as a fuel for heavy-duty and other vehicles.

Who is Charif Souki?

To put it in simple terms…Charif Souki is the Elon Musk of LNG.

Charif co-founded Tellurian and serves as Executive Chairman of the Board. He also founded Cheniere Energy, Inc. in 1996 and served as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President until December 2015. Prior to Cheniere, Charif was an investment banker. He serves on the board of trustees of the American University of Beirut and as a member of the Advisory Board of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Charif received a B.A. from Colgate University and an MBA from Columbia University.

Charif Souki was the highest-paid CEO in 2013; this proves that he’s the real deal. Charif Souki was voted out of his position at Cheniere by Carl Icahn. Charif Souki was fired because he wanted to expand Cheniere with projects such as Driftwood whereas Carl wanted to spend their cash flows on dividends. Carl Icahn to date has never met Charif Souki in person.

Charif Souki resurrected his Driftwood plans by co-founding Tellurian. 

What is Driftwood?

Driftwood LNG LLC, owned by Tellurian Inc., is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Once complete, the terminal will be able to export up to twenty-seven million, six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide.

Tellurian’s Team

The team at Tellurian together accounts for 75% of the LNG export from the USA today. In 2020; 5281 BCF of Natural Gas was exported from the USA. At current JKM (Asian Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $37,508,302,500. At current TTF prices (European Market) prices for June 2021, that is equivalent to around $32,161,290,000. These numbers tell you that the team at Tellurian is no joke and should not be taken lightly. 

The President &amp; CEO of Tellurian, Octávio Simões brings 38 years of impressive energy industry experience to Tellurian’s remarkable infrastructure team. Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG &amp; Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines, and storage facilities. He led the company’s efforts at Cameron LNG, Energia Costa Azul LNG and Port Arthur LNG, where he focused on reliability of deliveries to customers, safety and gas sourcing strategies that assure reliable production of LNG. Octávio has deep relationships in the LNG market and an unmatched tenacity for developing new projects.

Martin Houston the Vice Chairman and Co-founder is also an LNG veteran with nearly 40 years of experience. He’s managed all forms of enterprise in the energy industry, has established a strong external reputation in the international gas business, and is largely credited with being the key architect of BG Group’s world-class LNG business. In recognition of this, in 2011 he was the first recipient of the CWC LNG Executive of the Year award.

Why hasn’t Driftwood started construction yet?

The Driftwood project will cost $27.5 Billion including pipelines. Driftwood will produce 27.6 MTPA of LNG. Tellurian has been looking for Equity partners to help with the funding of Driftwood. Tellurian currently has one equity partner which is TOTAL SE. If FID for Driftwood isn’t reached by June 2021 then TOTAL can choose to back out of their position. If they choose to exit, it won’t be an issue for the company as Charif Souki “said building the terminal is no longer dependent on the Total agreement.” Tellurian currently has all permits required for Driftwood and Charif Souki confirmed that they are intending on starting basic construction this summer and planning on giving Bechtel the green light to begin full construction early next year.

What’s going on with commercial agreements?

In a recent interview with Citi Group, Charif Souki stated that ""We want to finish our commercial agreements, which will happen in the next few weeks,” Souki said the offering has been very popular and, if Tellurian hits its target in the next few weeks, would be oversubscribed.

A recent video targeting Short Sellers was posted by Tellurian. Charif Souki asked the shorts “What do you think is going to happen when we start announcing some of these long-term commercial agreements that we’ve been working on for so long? This will be an interesting question and we will see how the market reacts when this happens.” - We are the market and it’s our time to react.

Is TELL a quick trade or a long-term hold?

Charif Souki has made it clear that he is building a business and that TELL is not a trade. If you just want quick profits then this stock is NOT for you! 

Tellurian’s Competition:

Although no one in the US will be able to come up with a business model more profitable than Tellurian’s Driftwood. Qatar in many people’s eyes is seen as a big competitor and one that will destroy all US LNG exports but this is simply just not the case. Countries that import LNG diversify their “LNG portfolio” and will buy from a variety of countries and not just anyone in particular. No matter how profitable Qatar’s LNG plan is; Success is almost inevitable for TELL. Charif Souki personally talked about this and with utmost respect reassures us that Qatar is not a competitor. 

Stock Price📈:

Tellurian themselves have implied that the TELL stock will have a value of $12-$17 at FID! TELL is currently trading for $2.62! In the Citi Interview, Charif Souki said that the stock will have $7 FCF in a couple of years! The multiple for the FCF is decided by the market… but is usually around 10x+!🚀🚀🚀

Institutional Owners: - https://imgur.com/a/ssYRYfP

The top 3 institutional shareholders for Tellurian are State Street Corp, Blackrock INC &amp; Vanguard Group INC! State Street Corp recently disclosed that they added 20,783,999 shares adding to a grand total of 23,481,581 Shares. Blackrock and Vanguard own upwards of 13 million shares each! Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street don’t invest in companies that they don’t believe in. They believe in Tellurian and have proved it with the positions they have.

Why am I invested in Tellurian🦍🦍🚀🚀?

I am invested in Tellurian because I believe in the business model and also believe in the team. Charif Souki is a very intelligent man and Tellurian’s weekly “2 minutes with Charif” videos keep investors up to date about what is going on with LNG throughout the world along with the occasional updates about Driftwood. $TELL has been through a lot these past few months but we have been setting high lows and higher highs last week which makes it appear as so we are in the “c” or correction wave according to the Eliott Wave Theory. The fundamentals of this company haven’t changed and things are only getting better.

TELL Positions-  https://imgur.com/a/QjvCx4J

I am long TELL as you can tell by my positions. 

TL;DR - Tellurian teased their agreement with South Korea earlier today and TELL is basically in a correction. The announcements of commercial agreements will help the stock reach a fair value. This is not your regular start-up company as the team has a shit ton of experience. With a highly profitable business model along with big connections in the business; Tellurian is lined up for success and is just waiting for the perfect time. Carl Icahn a short seller caused the highly respected Charif Souki to be fired from his own company and shorts are betting against his new company. It’s time to crumble the shorts. It’s time for the bulls to takeover!

stocks,$CWH Camping World Holdings DD &amp; Analysis,"A bit of research of one of my newer positions of my portfolio. Take all of this with a grain of salt. I am not a financial professional. I'm barely a Finance student (but I will be this Summer), Graduated with an International Business degree, and decided to double major and get a degree in Finance from 2021-2022 for personal reasons mostly. Having said that, here is my Bull Case for Camping World Holdings:

Overview: Camping World Holdings benefited in both the short and long term from the pandemic due to the lockdown creating a larger market for it's signature products, RV's, camping supplies, and other outdoor recreational products. With two consecutive years of warm seasonal pandemic swings occuring, Camping World Holdings has been in the position to capitalize and increase its Earnings Per Share drastically over the last 2 years. Despite this, the stock is still trading at a PE ratio of 8.47, despite its recent wave of earnings justifying a price of over twice it's current price of 40, as it's 5 year average justifies the stock trading at a PE Ratio of 20.47. With another pandemic summer occurring with another round of stimulus checks in many people's pockets, and with potential post-pandemic economic growth, CWH is in a position to benefit from it's recent growth and continue to deliver strong earnings into the next few years. CWH is also starting to emerge as a sneaky dividend stock, as it has recently increased its quarter dividend from .23 a share to .25 and has a current dividend yield of  2.5%, which is above average in its industry. 

Pros:

Trades at a very attractive valuation currently: It's currently trading at a PE ratio of 8.47. Over the last 5 years it's Earnings have been consistent with a PE ratio of 20.47. At it's current share price of just under 40 dollars a share, this stock is very undervalued in my opinion as both a growth and a value stock. 

Starting to emerge as a dividend stock: The market median for a dividend stock in its industry is a yield of 2.28%. With CWH's recent dividend hike, their yield is reasonably above this median at 2.5% and is likely to grow higher in the future. 

Q2 Hype: CWH is set to report 2nd Quarter earnings on the 3rd of August, a good bit of time from now, but it has high expectations to live up to. The current Low/High ranges between 8 Analysts range from 1.77 to 2.65 per share. Having said that, there's no reason to think that CWH won't deliver. It beat it's Q1 estimate average of .70 by 1.40 a share, and the upcoming hot weather mixed with pent up stimulus spending is likely to help this company into the next Quarter. Regardless of the Earnings outcome, hype around this quarter is likely to drive up the price as the earnings date comes closer due to speculation. 

Cons:

Traits of a Cyclical Stock: CWH runs the risks of other stocks with cyclical traits. While I believe there is enough short term substance to pent up stimulus spending and access to cheap debt to justify a short to medium term recommendation, for long-term investors the stock may be prone to cyclical downfalls.  Seeing as a large part of their revenue stream is RV repairs, and current RV sales growth will mean more RV repairs down the road, I think the cyclical nature will somewhat even out. 

High Q2 Expectations Mean High Volatility Risk: If the stock fails to deliver relative to what's priced in during Q2 earnings, the stock might take a dive. Anyone who may need this money within the next few months might not want to deal with the potential volatility. 

Conclusion:

I believe Camping World Holdings is great as both a Value and a Growth stock and has the potential to be a strong performer for years to come. Already trading at a great valuation and poised to benefit from a post-pandemic economy with extra stimulus money to be spent, I believe this is a great stock to own at it's current price point, and to pick up during a dip for any medium to long term value/growth investor.",1621715071,"$CWH Camping World Holdings DD &amp; AnalysisA bit of research of one of my newer positions of my portfolio.

The Metaverse, Web3, and the Inevitability of NFTs

NFTs are here to stay and will be foundational to our new world 

Earlier this week, I explained how NFTs became so popular — seemingly out of nowhere.
IMO, NFTs are not a fad.
They’re not only here to stay as a new form of digital art, but they’re also going to a foundational technology for how the world will operate in the future.
It may sound like I’m being over-dramatic, but I assure you that I’m completely serious on that statement.
NFTs’ astronomic rise was the culmination of the initial innovation in 2017, the steadily established infrastructure of exchanges &amp; wallets, and macro tailwinds.
It’s the last bucket of macro tailwinds that ultimately led me to become super bullish on the future of NFTs.
I firmly believe two trends will shape the world in the next 10–15 years:

The Metaverse, and its proliferation on all aspects of society

Web3 and the democratization of the Internet

And the arrival of both trends will firmly rely on the technology of NFTs in order to be successful.
Let’s double click on each.

What is the Metaverse?

The Metaverse has a lot of varying definitions.
From Wikipedia, the Metaverse is described as a “collective, shared virtual space that is created when the physical realm converges with the virtual realm, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet.”
Author Neal Stephenson coined the term in his 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash. humans in the form of avatars interact with each other in a 3D world.
The term comes from the words “meta” — meaning “beyond’ — and “universe”.
So the Metaverse is an extension of our current existence.
Think of it as another virtual world that lives in parallel to our physical world — a world that we can freely access through the internet and compatible hardware devices.
The most popular depictions of the Metaverse in popular culture are Spielberg’s 2018 film, Ready Player One, and Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over.
And while the Metaverse can be seen as a game, it can also just be another plane of existence — where we can interact with one another.


Tron Legacy is a popular Metaverse depiction as well

The Metaverse is Inevitable

I believe that we’re rapidly moving towards a world where the Metaverse is not only real, but an integral part of our everyday lives.
Before you call me a crazy conspiracy theorist, hear me out.


The ethos behind the Metaverse is the creation of a digital space for us to live, socialize, and work — that transcends the space-time of our physical world.
Doesn’t that sound a little like… a Zoom meeting? Or a FaceTime with friends?
Or even a thread on Twitter? How about a game of Fortnite with friends — while talking on Discord?

During the pandemic lockdown, many of us have been forced to find social connections digitally — whether it be through video calls with friends, or for work using Zoom.
For me personally, I’ve a lot more time on Twitter, establishing connections in the tech and crypto spaces there.
This has led me to realize that activities that I had previously done IRL can now be ported to the digital realm: working, networking, socializing.
And that doesn’t mean there’s no room for IRL meetups. In-person relationships will still be important — especially in the year coming out of the Covid pandemic travel restrictions.
But it isn’t hard to imagine our world moving towards this direction — given all the trends I’ve outlined so far.

What is Web3?

Before we define Web3, we have to get a strong understanding of what Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 are.
Web 1.0 was the period time describing the advent of the Internet. When the World Wide Web was still a widely used term, and the dial-up sound was a common and unwelcomed occurrence.
Here, we had the initial surge of interest in e-commerce — leading to the eventual dot-com boom. We also had the first wave of internet browsers like Netscape and messaging platforms like AOL.
The term Web 2.0 was coined by O’Reilly and others between 1999 and 2004 — the early years post-Web 1.0.
Web 2.0 catapulted the world from simple static desktop web pages designed mainly for news — to interactive experiences, user-generated content, and marketplace economics that brought us NASDAQ giants like Uber, Facebook and Twitter. Web 2.0 was mobile-first, social-first, and cloud-only.

Web 2.0 unlocked trillions of dollars of value for the global economy, but in doing so, we — as consumers — gave up a lot of agency over our lives, in favor of the value of the services that a handful of companies provide us.
Today, we suffer from the consequences of that trade-off: handing over our individual freedoms in favor of centralized services.
Our every move is watched by the big tech companies: where we browse, where we shop, and even we are located in the physical world. They use this information to sell us products and nudge our behaviors to benefit their ultimate customer: the advertisers.
More on this dilemma is expertly covered in the Netflix doc The Social Dilemma.
Moreover, we allow these companies to house our information — leading to a single point of failure in the advent of a security breach.
We’ve had our personal and financial information exposed in the Target and Equifax hacks a few years back — with seemingly no repercussions from our governments.
This will continue in perpetuity in an arms race between black-hat hackers and security experts.
As a result, we’re entering a new era of the internet: Web 3.0 (or Web3) for short. An era that champions open, trustless and permissionless networks.

“Open” — meaning built on open standards, by an open and accessible community of developers and executed with full transparency

“Trustless”— meaning in that participants can interact with the comfort that all information is correct and authenticated — without needing to trust a third-party to verify

“Permissionless” — meaning that no one can be barred from participation, even from an authority figure like a government

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain protocols are the driving force behind the Web3 movement — with the vision of an open financial system in which anyone can build and participate without using gatekeepers like traditional financial institutions.

NFTs are Digital Ownership

Let’s think back on the two topics we just discussed: the Metaverse and Web3.
In the Metaverse, people have a secondary digital life, in which they can earn money and spend their leisure time in — unbounded by the restrictions of the physical world.
But if the Metaverse were to exist in a Web 2.0 setting, large centralized institutions like Facebook and Google will only the experience — living in their data centers that can be shut off by their whim, and gathering the data of our lives in order to sell for profit.
Imagine if your whole digital life lived on Facebook and you were only fed news that Facebook wanted you to see. If you said something in the Metaverse that Facebook didn’t want you to see (i.e., in concert with an authoritarian government), they could shut off your entire livelihood — akin to deleting an Instagram account if that account constituted your entire digital life.
If you’re going to live a sizable chunk of your existence in the Metaverse, you may as well have ownership over those digital items.
With Web3, end-consumers take back the ownership of their own data. Instead of forgoing their data and their privacy to the big tech companies, they’re able to control their own data — living in a cryptographic, decentralized mesh of computers that combine to become a distributed data center rivaling GCP and AWS.
Instead of Facebook owning your digital home, you actually own it. And you own the digital land on top of it. And all of your digital furniture.
And you’re able to do so with the power of NFTs.
NFTs cryptographically prove that you, and you alone, are the owner of your digital items. And no one else can take them away from you.

So now I’m a true believer of NFTs, but not because of its application as art.
Yes, NFTs have cracked the problem of digital scarcity, enabling creators for the first time ever to accurately price and safely distribute their works.
And yes, as a result, NFTs allow artists to monetize their work in a new way, empowering them to cut out money-grubbing middlemen and forming direct relationships with their supporters and fans.
But frankly, I don’t care about art — never have. That’s probably why I was so remiss to embrace NFTs in the first place.
Everything clicked together when I realized that inevitability of the Metaverse and Web3.
NFTs are the bridge between the two movements — a way to allow for open, trustless, decentralized ownership of the Metaverse.

I believe that we’re rapidly moving towards a world where the Metaverse is not only real, but an integral part of our everyday lives.
Before you call me a crazy conspiracy theorist, hear me out.


The ethos behind the Metaverse is the creation of a digital space for us to live, socialize, and work — that transcends the space-time of our physical world.
Doesn’t that sound a little like… a Zoom meeting? Or a FaceTime with friends?
Or even a thread on Twitter? How about a game of Fortnite with friends — while talking on Discord?

During the pandemic lockdown, many of us have been forced to find social connections digitally — whether it be through video calls with friends, or for work using Zoom.
For me personally, I’ve a lot more time on Twitter, establishing connections in the tech and crypto spaces there.
This has led me to realize that activities that I had previously done IRL can now be ported to the digital realm: working, networking, socializing.
And that doesn’t mean there’s no room for IRL meetups. In-person relationships will still be important — especially in the year coming out of the Covid pandemic travel restrictions.
But it isn’t hard to imagine our world moving towards this direction — given all the trends I’ve outlined so far.

What is Web3?

Before we define Web3, we have to get a strong understanding of what Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 are.
Web 1.0 was the period time describing the advent of the Internet. When the World Wide Web was still a widely used term, and the dial-up sound was a common and unwelcomed occurrence.
Here, we had the initial surge of interest in e-commerce — leading to the eventual dot-com boom. We also had the first wave of internet browsers like Netscape and messaging platforms like AOL.
The term Web 2.0 was coined by O’Reilly and others between 1999 and 2004 — the early years post-Web 1.0.
Web 2.0 catapulted the world from simple static desktop web pages designed mainly for news — to interactive experiences, user-generated content, and marketplace economics that brought us NASDAQ giants like Uber, Facebook and Twitter. Web 2.0 was mobile-first, social-first, and cloud-only.

Web 2.0 unlocked trillions of dollars of value for the global economy, but in doing so, we — as consumers — gave up a lot of agency over our lives, in favor of the value of the services that a handful of companies provide us.
Today, we suffer from the consequences of that trade-off: handing over our individual freedoms in favor of centralized services.
Our every move is watched by the big tech companies: where we browse, where we shop, and even we are located in the physical world. They use this information to sell us products and nudge our behaviors to benefit their ultimate customer: the advertisers.
More on this dilemma is expertly covered in the Netflix doc The Social Dilemma.
Moreover, we allow these companies to house our information — leading to a single point of failure in the advent of a security breach.
We’ve had our personal and financial information exposed in the Target and Equifax hacks a few years back — with seemingly no repercussions from our governments.
This will continue in perpetuity in an arms race between black-hat hackers and security experts.
As a result, we’re entering a new era of the internet: Web 3.0 (or Web3) for short. An era that champions open, trustless and permissionless networks.

“Open” — meaning built on open standards, by an open and accessible community of developers and executed with full transparency

“Trustless”— meaning in that participants can interact with the comfort that all information is correct and authenticated — without needing to trust a third-party to verify

“Permissionless” — meaning that no one can be barred from participation, even from an authority figure like a government

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain protocols are the driving force behind the Web3 movement — with the vision of an open financial system in which anyone can build and participate without using gatekeepers like traditional financial institutions.

NFTs are Digital Ownership

Let’s think back on the two topics we just discussed: the Metaverse and Web3.
In the Metaverse, people have a secondary digital life, in which they can earn money and spend their leisure time in — unbounded by the restrictions of the physical world.
But if the Metaverse were to exist in a Web 2.0 setting, large centralized institutions like Facebook and Google will only the experience — living in their data centers that can be shut off by their whim, and gathering the data of our lives in order to sell for profit.
Imagine if your whole digital life lived on Facebook and you were only fed news that Facebook wanted you to see. If you said something in the Metaverse that Facebook didn’t want you to see (i.e., in concert with an authoritarian government), they could shut off your entire livelihood — akin to deleting an Instagram account if that account constituted your entire digital life.
If you’re going to live a sizable chunk of your existence in the Metaverse, you may as well have ownership over those digital items.
With Web3, end-consumers take back the ownership of their own data. Instead of forgoing their data and their privacy to the big tech companies, they’re able to control their own data — living in a cryptographic, decentralized mesh of computers that combine to become a distributed data center rivaling GCP and AWS.
Instead of Facebook owning your digital home, you actually own it. And you own the digital land on top of it. And all of your digital furniture.
And you’re able to do so with the power of NFTs.
NFTs cryptographically prove that you, and you alone, are the owner of your digital items. And no one else can take them away from you.

So now I’m a true believer of NFTs, but not because of its application as art.
Yes, NFTs have cracked the problem of digital scarcity, enabling creators for the first time ever to accurately price and safely distribute their works.
And yes, as a result, NFTs allow artists to monetize their work in a new way, empowering them to cut out money-grubbing middlemen and forming direct relationships with their supporters and fans.
But frankly, I don’t care about art — never have. That’s probably why I was so remiss to embrace NFTs in the first place.
Everything clicked together when I realized that inevitability of the Metaverse and Web3.
NFTs are the bridge between the two movements — a way to allow for open, trustless, decentralized ownership of the Metaverse.

But their financial are just too good.  I spoke with several Chinese people yesterday who are living and working in China.  I wanted to get a feel for what the situation is on the ground, how they see the economy, future and thoughts on BABA/Jack Ma.


BABA Has 5 Operating Segments


China Commerce (65%): Segment revenues are derived from retail e-commerce and associated marketing services in China.


China Wholesale &amp; Other (12%): Segment revenues are derived from wholesale commerce and logistics services, primarily driven by Chinese consumption.


Cloud Computing (8%): Segment revenues are derived based on customers' duration and usage of Alibaba's service.

International Commerce (8%): Segment revenues are derived from retail and wholesale operations as well as from advertising services outside China.


Digital Media &amp; Innovation Initiatives (7%): Segment revenues are derived from content subscription, software subscription and merchant advertising offerings.

Alibaba (BABA) is one of the largest companies in China.  It's hard to truly understand everything they do, as they are involved in just about everything.  When Chinese pay for something, they don't use credit cards.  They use either WeChat/WeiXin (Tencent) or they use Alipay (BABA).  Nearly every Chinese person has these 2 apps on their phone.  It is essential.

View from China

In speaking to Chinese people, as I have done for years, you have to understand everything is always going to be optimistic. From TV news to social media ""influencers"", the government is always sending messages to the people about how great...everything is and how not to trust outsiders.  So at first everyone was overly optimistic and diffused any thoughts I had of negative impressions.  This was to be expected.  As you dig further traces of truth open up.

First, China has done a decent job of getting the virus under control...but it's not as far a the US.  The population is so large it is going to take a full year from today to get 70% vaccinated.

These vaccines are less effective than what the US has.  They are in Phase III trials of their own mRNA vaccine which should be better.

Tourism won't come back this year as China is requiring everyone to have taken the Chinese vaccine to enter china as the moment.  

There is general optimism but I would call it cautious optimism.  The economy seems to be holding well, virus seems to be holding well...but many fear this could fall apart if something goes wrong.  

BABA

When asked about BABA and Jack Ma everyone heard about the fine paid by the company.  The said China is trying to crack down on monopolies and thus considered Alibaba as such.  All remain positive about Alibaba and Jack Ma but understood the government wants to protect the people.

What they think will happen?

Many felt Alibaba will continue to do well, but due to China's warning to them about Monopoly, they feel Alibaba will slow it's pace of growth.  Either intentional or mandated, this wasn't sure.  Alibaba can not continue on the same path forever.  It will not be allowed.  The fine was a warning to them.  Next step would be much drastic (prison for executives, company take over).  

---

Conclusion

Chinese are optimistic on their economy and Alibaba but with caution.  

I better understand the drop in BABA now.  It's not about how great they were in the past, but the fear of what will happen if they continue this way...and realistically they can not continue.  
A few speculated that the company will now be more controlled by the government but this is speculation.

stocks,Want to invest in biotech? A quick guide.,"Short answer: don't. I work in the industry and learned early on not to touch it with a ten-foot pole. If you want to invest in the pharma/biopharma/biotech industry, investing in small-cap biotech stocks - MBIO, VKTX, ATOS, etc. for examples is basically gambling. Here are the alternatives I suggest.

Supply chain. TMO and AVTR are the two biggest suppliers of consumables in the life sciences industry and essentially hold a duopoly. Both are basically trying to position themselves as the amazon of the industry. TMO is more diversified offering various services and high-powered equipment and is on the cutting-edge of R&amp;D in a lot of equipment fields (MS and cryo-EM). AVTR owns VWR which is basically like an Amazon/costco hybrid for companies and academia. I highly recommend choosing one or both.

Equipment. TMO/AVTR kind of fall into this category but I wanted to make a different section because they pretty much own the entire consumables market. Instrumentation has a lot more competition. While something like TMO has its hands dipped into anything, almost nobody would choose a TMO HPLC over Agilent (A) or Waters (WAT). PCR? Bio-Rad (BIO). Centrifuges? Beckman Coulter (DHR). A lot of companies have carved out niches for themselves whereas something like TMO is a generalist. You also have companies like DHR that hold brands like Beckman Coulter that have a lot of brand loyalty.

Services. CROs like IQVIA, PPD, manufacturing services, instrumentation (calibration, maintenance) services etc. One of the most expensive things about the industry is the regulatory hurdles, especially clinical trials. CROs help companies save money on clinical trials by outsourcing them to companies already equipped to handle different parts of them. Equipment has to have records of being ""up to spec"" for audit purposes and a lot of companies do this stuff in-house or let the vendors send service techs out. You also have companies like TMO with their unity service that do this stuff. They also recently bought out Patheon and PPD so they're expanding the services side of their company a lot.

Tech. This sort of falls under equipment and services so I won't spend too long on it, but companies like Illumina have revolutionized things in their fields (DNA sequencing for Illumina).

Big pharma/biopharma/biotech. You can still benefit from the excitement of a positive clinical trial result without the volatility. The issue with small-cap biotech is that you'll bleed out 70% over the course of a few months, and by the time you get that 25% bump from a positive trial result you're still extremely deep in the red. These companies completely hinge on a very small amount of drugs which is why they're such a gamble. Companies like PFE, ABBV have blockbuster drugs under their belt that keep them relatively stable and allow them to pay dividends. The 25% bump from a positive result you'd see from biotech is buffered to be more like 5-10%, but at least you know you won't (probably) lose 90% of your investment.

Last but not least... ETFs. Pharma, biotech and medical devices ETFs all hold a lot of these aforementioned categories/companies.",1621696827,"Want to invest in biotech?

Equipment has to have records of being ""up to spec"" for audit purposes and a lot of companies do this stuff in-house or let the vendors send service techs out. You also have companies like TMO with their unity service that do this stuff. They also recently bought out Patheon and PPD so they're expanding the services side of their company a lot.

Tech. This sort of falls under equipment and services so I won't spend too long on it, but companies like Illumina have revolutionized things in their fields (DNA sequencing for Illumina).

Big pharma/biopharma/biotech. You can still benefit from the excitement of a positive clinical trial result without the volatility. The issue with small-cap biotech is that you'll bleed out 70% over the course of a few months, and by the time you get that 25% bump from a positive trial result you're still extremely deep in the red. These companies completely hinge on a very small amount of drugs which is why they're such a gamble. Companies like PFE, ABBV have blockbuster drugs under their belt that keep them relatively stable and allow them to pay dividends. The 25% bump from a positive result you'd see from biotech is buffered to be more like 5-10%, but at least you know you won't (probably) lose 90% of your investment.

Last but not least... ETFs. Pharma, biotech and medical devices ETFs all hold a lot of these aforementioned categories/companies.",3201,41,3160

This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that cause no harm to the environment, something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yes (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, just 10% off it's 52 week low.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021.

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
&gt; The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Investors are watching the wild swings in b/itcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
&gt; A steep plunge in b/itcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on b/itcoin mining and trading.
*****
&gt; “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where b/itcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. B/itcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
&gt; The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
&gt; “B/itcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by b/itcoin.”
*****
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
&gt; But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
&gt; “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”
*****
&gt; The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
&gt; # No correction yet
&gt; As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
&gt; Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
&gt; “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
&gt; Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
&gt; Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
&gt; The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.
*****
&gt; “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”
*****
&gt; He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
&gt; Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
&gt; “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
&gt; The b/itcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting b/itcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

&gt; # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

&gt; While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**

&gt; Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

&gt; # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&amp;P 500 Month

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&amp;P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

&gt; # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

&gt; The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**

&gt; Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

&gt; Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

&gt; Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

&gt; Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

&gt; Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

&gt; In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**

&gt; Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady

&gt; Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

&gt; The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**

&gt; Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**

&gt; As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

&gt; # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

&gt; Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",1621680749,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021.

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
&gt; The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Investors are watching the wild swings in b/itcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
&gt; A steep plunge in b/itcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on b/itcoin mining and trading.
*****
&gt; “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where b/itcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. B/itcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
&gt; The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
&gt; “B/itcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by b/itcoin.”
*****
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
&gt; But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
&gt; “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”
*****
&gt; The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
&gt; # No correction yet
&gt; As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
&gt; Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
&gt; “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
&gt; Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
&gt; Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
&gt; The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.
*****
&gt; “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”
*****
&gt; He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
&gt; Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
&gt; “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”
*****
&gt; Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
&gt; The b/itcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting b/itcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

&gt; # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

&gt; While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**

&gt; Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

&gt; # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&amp;P 500 Month

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&amp;P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

&gt; # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

&gt; The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**

&gt; Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

&gt; Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

&gt; Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

&gt; Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

&gt; Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

&gt; In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**

&gt; Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady

&gt; Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

&gt; The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-HL.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**

&gt; Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**

&gt; As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

&gt; # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

&gt; Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

stocks,good individual companies for my new fidelity portfolio?,"this is kinda a part 2 to my other post on this subreddit, but my father and I are opening a fidelity account for me, as previously I bought stocks through him.

&amp;#x200B;

Key points:

&amp;#x200B;

The transaction will result in Redbox becoming a publicly traded company with an enterprise value of $693 million.

&amp;#x200B;

The transaction, approved unanimously by the boards of both companies, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021. At that point, Redbox’s common stock is expected to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “RDBX.” The transaction is being funded by a combination of $145 million of cash held in the trust account of Seaport Global Acquisition and a private investment in public equity (PIPE) commitment of $50 million led by Ophir Asset Management.

&amp;#x200B;

After the deal closes, Redbox expects to have approximately $209 million in cash that will be used to pay down existing debt and fund digital expansion, content acquisition and marketing initiatives.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Redbox, it generated $114 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in 2020.

stocks,"Staying away from those EV startups that are targeting Hydrogen Fuel Cell plays, or Fool Cells (incl. Nikola and Advent Technologies)","This week is the time for pivoting away from those EV startups that are targeting hydrogen fuel cell plays, or Fool Cells.

This week, the next Papa of EV World, Herbert Diess, referenced this bit of news from earlier this month:

[Hydrogen instead of electrification? Potentials and risks for climate targets](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/hydrogen-instead-of-electrification-potentials-and-risks-for-climate-targets)

The CEO of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, stated that hydrogen fuel cell technology is not feasible for at least a decade:

[https://interestingengineering.com/vw-ceo-says-electric-batteries-are-better-than-hydrogen-cars](VW CEO Says Electric Batteries Are Better than Hydrogen Cars)

&gt; The German newspaper Handelsblatt was the first to report on the PIK's research, which in turn sparked Diess's Twitter post, stating (in German) ""Such fuels as a universal climate solution are a bit of a false promise. While they are wonderfully versatile, they cannot be expected to replace fossil fuels on a large scale. This can only be achieved with direct electrification.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 21, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 21, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) declining modestly after yesterday’s rally. It’s encouraging to see the market holding on to yesterday’s gains following the volatility experienced in recent weeks. It seems overall market sentiment is improving following a surge in inflationary fears after the release of the April Consumer Price Index. The SPY closed 0.08% down, the QQQ closed 0.56% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.36% up.

Markets have recently been shaken by the prospect that a rise in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. However, as has been reiterated in the recap before, there are several reasons why a change in monetary policy seems very unlikely. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), one of the leading semiconductor companies, jumped after the company announced a 4-1 split. This means that after the split goes through, every share of  NVDA will become 4 and the price will adjust accordingly.
* In the midst of surging prices, the housing market has begun showing signs of slowing down. Today, the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales fell 2.7% in April compared to the month prior. That is well below the expectation of 1% growth and may be a sign the rise in prices may be slowing in the near-term. However, compared to April 2020, existing home sales are up 33.9%.
* Snap (SNAP) said it will acquire WaveOptics, a British Augmented Reality company, for over $500 million. The company has recently been making a big push into the world of wearable AR technology.
* China's internet watchdog said on Friday that companies including ByteDance, Baidu, and Microsoft (MSFT) improperly collected user data in the country.
* Yesterday, the US Department of Treasury announced it was taking steps to crackdown on digital assets by requiring any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
* China’s Financial Stability and Development Commission, which is chaired by Vice Premier Liu He, released a statement today saying it is necessary to “crack down on digital asset mining and trading behavior and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to the social field.”

stocks,30 years old. Here is my portfolio strategy - please criticize,"Started trading options January. Read that entire thetagang wiki. Became obsessed and watched maybe 80 videos explaining the math. So please correct my thinking / rationale. 

I have a core position that I will never sell until 60 (+30 years from now). Consists of : AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, VTI, ARKK, ARKG, ARKF. Keep adding on 5% dips (except Arks). 
_______
Next: I have a few short positions. ARKK, ARKF and ARKG. More shares of the short than long because I am bearish in the short term and want to capitalize on my prediction. Once they dip some more, I will cover and reinvest all that profit back into my longs because I am bullish long term. 
_____
Options:

I have been using margin to sell weekly cash covered puts on TSLA for the past 6 weeks and have been collecting $250 a week. IV is close to 100% on the strikes so technically I’m IV-gang, but actually timevalue is high enough for the volatility of TSLA. Planning on continuing doing this. 

Then besides TSLA if there are fundamentally strong stocks that dipped 3-4 %, I like to sell weekly CSPs on those as well. So far it’s been AAPL, QQQ, SPY, MSFT. 

Total profit averaged each of the last 6 weeks from these is $300. Which to me is fantastic. 

Then I use this money to reinvest into my core - whoever/whenever dips. 

____

Conclusion / Strategy:

Core is sold when I retire. When core corrects, I buy more. Whenever the next black swan market crash occurs, core stays untouched. Don’t need the money and don’t care for short term tax. (Unless ofc my thesis in the fundamental of the stock changes, then I will plan to exit positions). 

Shorts/ Hedges: When any of my core positions start entering bubble-popping territory or are otherwise becoming overvalued, core stays untouched, but I will open small positions to short those core securities, and/or write calls andor buy puts. I hate buying puts but whatever makes most sense in that scenario. Once I’ve accumulated a “decent” amount, and I am no longer bearish, I close and reinvest back into the core. 

Options: I want to keep doing this every fuckin week man. $300 a week or even $200 a week is amazing money. That’s almost your entire food bill for a month. I invest typically 50% of each paycheck. And now I get to add more capital from these puts. And best of all, it’s mostly stress-free because I do choose strikes I am COMFORTABLE owning. I do need to migrate towards other stocks though besides blue chip tech.

Random thoughts:

-/ not trying to sound naive / nonchalant that it’s fully risk free. But then again I’m not chasing $10 premiums. I’m targeting the $2-$3 range. 

-/ sometimes when the premium is crappy , I’ll extend TDE but then exit early once I reach profit goal. And then I can sell more. 

-/ someone surely is going to ask why I’m selling naked puts on margin.  It’s naked because the cash is in the bank. It’s margin because I can spend more. I understand the risks and I have capital in the bank and I appreciate your thoughtful concerns :)

stocks,Double Tops and Upward Triangles,"So I've been reading the past few hours and I'm having trouble seeing how double tops and upward triangles are related (if at all). This started out with me seeing that COST had a double top flagged on FINVIZ, so I looked it up because I was curious.

Like if there is a dip in the middle of the day for one stock there will be a dip for all of them. What causes this? I know it takes massive amounts of money to move a stock even just a little so in order for there to be a huge dip a lot of people would have to sell at the exact same time. Like within 30 minutes.

Basically, coca cola (I'll just say KO for now on) was shown to have a div/yield of around 3. On top of that, KO isn't going anywhere any time soon, and even though it's a gigantic thing, it's only at around 54 dollars per share. I'm thinking of buying a bit more shares of this than I normally would, around 19-20 or so, so I can get a decent amount of dividends and put those back into investing. Plus they pay out dividends very soon about next month, and quarterly at that. I have tried to play it as intelligently as I could, and if something may seem dumb, to me it made logical sense. I've mostly been investing in ETF's, with only Visa being my one blue collar company. I was wondering if it would be wise to then buy a few of KO as my next blue collar company, and buy more for the dividends aspect too. I do not want to invest in random stuff like the rip-toe currency stuff (can't say it because word filters are stupid), and I just want to be a long term investor. So again, as intelligently as I could think

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Hi all,

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!",1621567613,"How will reopening affect Amazon?I am also posting this on r/investing, so sorry about the duplicate if it applies to you.

stocks,(DJCO) My mini-essay investment thesis for The Daily Journal - Why you should buy a dying newspaper business,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

---

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 20, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 20, 2021**

Stocks snapped their modest three-day losing streak and jumped higher today, with market participants encouraged by the Weekly Unemployment Report and inflationary fears tempering. As I said yesterday, I was encouraged to see volatility decreasing this week after the wild swing the market experienced recently and am even more encouraged by today’s movement that the sharp sell-off was overdone. 

The Department of Labor released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed 444,000 new jobless claims filed, a fresh pandemic low and marginally better than the 450,000 expected by economists. To put this into context, in April of last year, more than 6 million individuals filed jobless claims in one week. While the improvement in the labor market has been extremely encouraging, in the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes (basically notes about what was discussed in the meeting) noted “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy.

““The secret of getting ahead is getting started.” - Mark Twain",1621544618,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 20, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 20, 2021**

Stocks snapped their modest three-day losing streak and jumped higher today, with market participants encouraged by the Weekly Unemployment Report and inflationary fears tempering. As I said yesterday, I was encouraged to see volatility decreasing this week after the wild swing the market experienced recently and am even more encouraged by today’s movement that the sharp sell-off was overdone. 

The Department of Labor released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed 444,000 new jobless claims filed, a fresh pandemic low and marginally better than the 450,000 expected by economists. To put this into context, in April of last year, more than 6 million individuals filed jobless claims in one week. While the improvement in the labor market has been extremely encouraging, in the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes (basically notes about what was discussed in the meeting) noted “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

I have a theory that the Institutions, the big boys of wall street, are getting out under cover.

They all know what's coming down the pipe. I think the big players in the market are taking a lot off the table on the good days. Retail investors buy on the good news. And if they sell at the same time it doesn't bring down the stock **as much**. Sort of making their ways towards the exit without starting a Chinese fire drill.

They have been playing the game a lot longer than 90% of the people in the markets now. They've learned how to make moves without making too much noise.

Anybody else feel like something's going on here?",1621542876,"Companies Beat Earnings and Then Fall in Price.I've been seeing this a lot lately. A company beats on earnings and still drops like it came up short.

They passed when I was 2/3, so it was quite a bit by the time I reached 18. Coupled with my great-grandparents (who were absolutely gems and raised me until 10/11) adding a bit from their estate, upon dispersement, there was a pretty penny.

I’ve long been interested in investing, but I’m 24 and I haven’t had any real extra money since living on my own at 18. After this though, I’d like to put at least $1,000 into some kind of investment; after reading about the absolute SHITE that is interest on savings accounts—and I don’t want to blow all of it because I have little restraint/budgeting knowledge—I thought I could take a portion and try to make some actual money with it. I’m willing to put at most $5k…because if I lose that, it would SUCK but I would be okay.

If you guys have any insight/tips, advice or….any guidance at all, I would greatly appreciate it. I have…very little knowledge about the intricacies of trading and really just have had an impulse to invest a few times….which if I HAD done, with the money I didn’t have to lose at the time, would have made bank… like I could have bought Tesla when they first went public, but thought just because I like the company doesn’t mean anything and it was too confusing to try to learn.

So, anyway TL;DR : I’'m....definitely a novice lady,, but the few times I've found companies that I believed in, and thought would be profitable, I didn't act on that gut feeling. Also found it to be confusing to figure out HOW to buy and set up an online acct, etc. I  would GREATLY appreciate some tips and tricks/discussion. Please!

Is this actually the case? Looking at the past decade (I know this doesn't predict future performance per say) but the large caps have grown considerably. AAPL for example doubled from 1T to 2T market cap in just two years which is wild. I know their growth has slowed since then but with them constantly killing earnings and continuously diversifying (M chips etc. ) is there any reason for them to slow or be outperformed by smaller companies this decade? I know they're considered a little overvalued, but that's the nature of large cap growth stocks in general.

Additionally, inflation tends to be less hard on large caps compared to smaller ones. Depending on how much inflation is coming over the next say 3-5 years, won't this also be another advantage for the largest cap companies?

stocks,Trading Psychology Question - Assistance Please,"Hey, guys! Thanks for taking time to read this. This is my first post here, but I know you are best equipped to handle this over the other subs I follow.

I know my strengths, and I also know my weaknesses. It's my recognized weakness I need assistance with.

Like many, I started in the markets last year. My 1099 for 2020 was a $22,000 loss in the biggest bull run in history. My 2021 is at $0 due to exiting positions at my CB out of fear of further losses. 

I feel you need to understand more about me to offer more sound advice, so, in short: I'm in my late 30s. I spent most of my 20s in and out of homelessness. Sleeping in basements of relatives, friends couches, out of my Jeep Cherokee. I was a failure. The only thing good in my life, was the love of my life, who left me due to me being such a financial disaster. I tried. I really did. I just always failed.

After she left, I fell into alcohol, prescription drugs, and depression. I eventually tried the only thing I hadn't tried - crime. I failed at that, too. I did 4 years in prison.

Since I was released 4 years ago, I have tried to start over. Nobody will hire me now. It took me a solid year to find an employer willing to give me a chance. I work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and finally earn a 6 figure salary. The problem is it's killing me. I now have a 180 resting blood pressure and a 14 cortisol level. I'm dying. I can't sustain this forever. I'm trying to use this opportunity to get ahead while I can. Now I keep failing.

My issue: I don't trust myself. I spend hours on DD, and will have a few stocks I like - companies I believe in. I'll wait for an entry, but when it comes, I'm scared to buy it. I hesitate. Then it rallies. Then I get anxiety because I missed it. I get depressed because I was right but failed to act. I can't chase it now because that's what led to my 2020 losses - chasing something only to buy in just before it consolidates. Then I'm depressed because I'm failing again. 

It's like, when the price comes down, I'm scared to buy because it might go lower and I fail. If it goes higher, I don't buy it because I feel like a sucker for not buying it at the lower price yesterday. Then it rallies, and then I get depression anxiety over missing it. Sometimes just having my mouse over the buy button can cause a panic attack. 

Normally I would say I just need to index, but I don't have 30 years to index. I may have another 2 years in me before this job kills me. I will never have another opportunity like this being a felon. I'm trying to seize opportunity and finally make a good enough gain, that I can then invest much more conservatively moving forward. 

My 2 losses last year would have been my biggest gains had I held  - my DD was correct. Even my price targets were correct. I couldn't trust myself. I tried to learn from this. Now I was up $80,000 YTD on 3 positions, but now I have $0 because I rode them all the way down trying not to panic sell like last year. If I hold - I fail. If I sell - I fail. I'm obviously good at picking winners, but how do I get out of my own way? Every time I act, I was wrong. Every time I fail to act, I was right. How can I ever trust myself given my history?

stocks,Worth selling,"Last April I opened a taxable account as a ""Buy an old Jeep fund"" and scooped up several Mortgage REITS on the low with the intention of either collecting the div, or selling once they top out/exceed Book Value. I'm currently sitting on a 75% - 130% gain on all three of them and have been collecting a high dividend yield since. 

As you can see on the table below, the book value has been stagnant for the last 3-ish quarters, and are priced very close to book value.

While they haven't necessarily topped out, aside from collecting the high dividend yield, I don't see a clear or significant upside anymore. This is also considering Mortgage REITS historically tend to trade within 1-2% of book value. 

My question - I've been holding these for over a year now, would it be worth paying the capital gains tax to sell and buy something with better growth prospects?

stocks,SQM and lithium demand,"I have been out of lithium miners since the beginning of this year after I exited my Livent position at what I thought was a peak at ~$20 per share. As I see them rally again I decided to look into more value oriented plays. Although I am a big fan of mining companies currently, I though that lithium miners we're about priced in when it came to forward demand. 

That being said, I have always still kept an eye on stocks such as albemarle and SQM. SQM seems to be at a very good value standpoint right now after they got beat up due to the chilean government transition. I believe at this point the stock is oversold and now is a good time to take a position. The company trades at a relatively high p/e right now, but I believe higher lithium prices and higher quality lithium demand will be a factor in their growth moving forward to 2022 and 2023. 

SQM's long term debt stands at just under $2b, which I do not think is terrible given how much of it was acquired during covid. They are also not a lithium pure play, and have a sizable portion of the market for iodine, which is used in the medical field as well as potassium nitrates for fertilizers. Their main income is definitely from lithium and this will continue to be true.

They have a joint venture in Australia that is supposedly coming online in the middle of this year that is focused on production of lithium hydroxide. This is a risk it seems as SQM has not produced lithium from a hard rock project it seems and this holds execution risk, although I am not worried much about it, it is worth noting. Another risk would be the chilean government altering land agreements and taxes, which is also probably not too much of a worry as lithium is taxed heavily as is. The land agreements even less so because most changes to land would be for private entities, and SQM leases their land from the government. 

All in all, the risk reward on this stock after the sell off seems relatively solid and I have initiated a position and plan to hold/dca down if the opportunity presents. Lithium prices are still quite low and the company doing better will depend on the lithium prices creeping up for the next few years as demand is supposed to increase substantially. 

Albemarle is also a great company, I haven't read up on them too much, but I believe at a quick glance, you could get away with starting a position now and averaging down if the chance presents itself. These are my the 2 companies that I would recommend to actually go long on for lithium mining. The LIT ETF is also good, but I prefer individual stock picking.",1621523952,"SQM and lithium demandI have been out of lithium miners since the beginning of this year after I exited my Livent position at what I thought was a peak at ~$20 per share.

stocks,Virgin Galactic Confirms Upcoming Test Flight of VSS Unity on May 22,"*Test flight scheduled to take place on May 22*

Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPCE) (""Virgin Galactic"" or the ""Company""), a vertically integrated aerospace and space travel company, today confirmed that the next rocket-powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo Unity will be conducted on May 22, pending weather and technical checks. This follows the completion of a maintenance review of VMS Eve, the mothership jet aircraft designed to carry SpaceShipTwo to an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet.

""Following a detailed inspection and thorough analysis of our mothership, Eve, we have cleared our Spaceflight System for our upcoming flight. I want to thank our incredibly talented team of engineers, maintenance crew, quality inspectors and support staff for their diligence and hard work, which is testament to our commitment to safety and the integrity of our flight test program,"" said Michael Colglazier, Chief Executive Officer of Virgin Galactic.

Virgin Galactic regularly monitors its vehicles to verify their condition and inform timing of future upgrades and modifications that can improve performance or reduce future maintenance work. A post-flight inspection of VMS Eve in early May called for further engineering analysis to assess a known maintenance item in the tail of the vehicle, which was scheduled to be addressed during the next maintenance period. This analysis has been completed with the Company determining structures healthy, clearing Eve for flight.

The upcoming VSS Unity test flight will be crewed by two pilots and will carry research payloads as part of the NASA Flight Opportunities program. A key objective of the upcoming flight will be to test the remedial work that has been completed on VSS Unity to lower the EMI levels experienced on the December 12, 2020 flight when the onboard computer halted ignition of the rocket motor. The flight will also incorporate all original test objectives, including assessment of the upgraded horizontal stabilizers and flight controls during the boost phase of the flight, evaluating elements of the customer cabin, and testing the live stream capability from the spaceship to the ground.

Following this May flight, and in line with normal procedures, the team will complete an extensive data review, which will inform the next steps in the test flight program.

stocks,Can I offset more than 3k in capital losses from stocks from last year against capital gains from this year with no trader status?,"So about me:
Got into trading last year, was unemployed, don't have trader tax status

So my question is regarding deducting a large capital loss last year against a large capital gain this year and if there is a 3k cap on that if i don't have trader tax status?

for example, if last year (2020), let's say i had 20k in capital loss from stocks. Now this year (2021), let's say i have 100k in capital gains.  CAn i deduct the full 20k capital loss from last year to this year's 100k capital loss, making my taxable capital gain income essentially 80k?   OR since i just a regular trader with no trader tax status with the IRS, i can only deduct 3k of that capital loss this each and the remainder carries over each year, making this year's taxable capital gain income 97k?

I'm reading online and there is so many conflicting info.  Some say that it's 3k max each year, and you will only be able to deduct 3k until you deduct the full capital loss through the years, every year.  Others say that only up to 3k of the 20k loss is deductible  if it is against ""Regular income"", but if you have a huge capital gain this year (like 100k in this example), you can deduct the full 20k for this year.

I know, before you guys say go to speak to an expert cpa and etc...yes yes i know, i will.. But i am still also wanting to hear advice or answer of anyone who's been in this situation before.  Thank you. I will read up and gather more info in the meanwhile, but i would appreciate any extra insight that anyone here can provide on the situation.

stocks,"If badcoin keeps dropping, Tesla will have to report a loss next quarter. That would be funny","Elon got to be having fun overseeing Tesla’s accounting.

He had Tesla buy ‘coins, whose price is largely influenced by his tweets. If tweeting is fun, I can imagine tweeting and watching an asset price move in response has to be even more! Owning said asset probably entitles to some additional giggles.

Then last quarter Tesla sold some of the bitthings to “prove liquidity”. I’m not sure if anyone felt the need of such proof, but by lucky coincidence this had the totally unintended side effect to allow Tesla to post a profit for the quarter. Cheers!

How could this story become even more amusing?
Here is a possibility: if the coins price falls below the estimated $3,700 buying price and Tesla still HODL it next quarter, it will have to immediately report a loss on it.

Given Elon’s loving care for Tesla’s share price, if ‘coin price keeps slumping as Earnings approach he may take the first chance to dump it at break-even or better price.
Probably claiming the reason to Save the Earth from coin’s carbon footprint or something, maybe after some semi related tweet pumping in a plausibly-deniable way.

That would be good for Tesla, maybe. But most likely bad for both ‘coins price and Elon’s reputation.

Anyway, if ‘coins price goes down there is potential for some new Musk-related drama.

stocks,Is my companies ESPP really that good of a deal?,"I participate in my companies ESPP. Before Covid, the stock seemed to be fairly steady. It did dive during Covid, but has since recovered, which led me to nice gains (200%) on the last purchase. But usually I just sell it immediately for the 15% gain they let us purchase for 15% off. 

But I’m thinking, is this really that great of a deal? 

I put in 10% of my paycheck. So this is post tax money. 

I’m in about the 15% avg tax rate. 

So say I make $100,000 a year. (Married we make around $220,000 after deductions)

I am taxed $15,000 annually. (15%) 

I put in $8500 of post tax money into the ESPP. ($85,000*10%). 

Company lets me buy at 15% discount. So I get let’s say $9,775. So I spent $8,500 to get $9,775. Nice! 

Then I pay short term capital gains tax of $195. So that’s a net of $9584. 

But I was taxed on that initial $8500. 15% is my avg bracket. So that pre tax money was $9775. So now I’m losing money. I earned $10,000 to make $9584. 

Why not just put this directly into my 401k where I am not taxed on it (obviously until I retire) and my $10,000 (10%) is a real $10,000 into my account? 

Can someone tell me if my math and logic is correct?",1621491679,"Is my companies ESPP really that good of a deal?I participate in my companies ESPP.

stocks,Frontline - a tanker company that seems to do everything right in the last years," Frontline Ltd., a shipping company, engages in the seaborne transportation of crude oil and oil products worldwide. It owns and operates oil and product tankers. As of December 31, 2020, the company operated a fleet of 68 vessels. It is also involved in the charter, purchase, and sale of vessels.

Starting with a PE ratio of 4 and a PB ratio of 1 is always a good start. But then again most taker companies are now trading at a low PE ratio. Their net income, revenue and profit margin were increasing in the last 3 years which is a really good sign. One not so good sign is their debt which has increased from 1.8 to 2.2 billion in the last 4 years.

You could consider that shipping oil is not a good business anymore because renewables but changing to renewables cannot be done in an instant so the transition will be slow. For example the Chinese oil consumption reached an all time high in December 2020. In the same time a lot of companies have reduced their number of shipping vessels due to the low demand in last year. 

To take something from their SEC filling regarding risk:

“The demand for our oil tankers derives primarily from demand for Arabian Gulf, West African, North Sea, Caribbean, Russian and US Shale crude oil, which, in turn, primarily depends on the economies of the world's industrial countries and competition from alternative energy sources. Any decrease in shipments of crude oil or change in trade patterns from the above mentioned geographical areas would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Among the factors which could lead to such a decrease are:

• increased crude oil production from other areas;

• increased refining capacity in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

• increased use of existing and future crude oil pipelines in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

• a decision by oil-producing nations to increase their crude oil prices or to further decrease or limit their crude oil production;

• armed conflict in the Arabian Gulf and West Africa and political or other factors; and

• the development, availability and the costs of nuclear power, natural gas, coal and other alternative sources of energy. In addition, volatile economic conditions affecting world economies may result in reduced consumption of oil products and a decreased demand for our vessels and lower charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our ability to pay dividends. “

I don’t really know how to evaluate these so I will let you evaluate them. They also say that “If the tanker industry, which historically has been cyclical and volatile, declines in the future, our revenues, earnings and available cash flow may be adversely affected.“ which basically means the earnings might go up or they might go down. The same is with the stock price.

Personally I think they will do well at least the next year because the demand for oil is still high, China is running on all cylinders because they need more and more energy, the airlines will start having more airplanes in the sky which will kickstart refineries and until “green solutions“ kick in we will need something.

&gt; In a deal that hands a huge victory to shareholders of bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings Inc., the car renter picked Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management to buy the company out of Chapter 11, capping a dramatic brawl for control of the company.
&gt; 
&gt; The deal, which gives a reorganized Hertz an enterprise value of $7.43 billion, was picked over an offer from a competing group led by Centerbridge Partners, Warburg Pincus and Dundon Capital Partners, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plan hasn’t been made public. The Knighthead-Certares plan would give equity holders a recovery of about $8 a share -- a package that’s made up of about $240 million in cash and warrants for nearly 20% of the reorganized company, the people said.
&gt; 
&gt; Hertz shares -- which up until two months ago were faced with the prospects of being completely wiped out under an earlier plan -- soared as much as 41% Wednesday to as high as $5.19. That approached a high of $6.25 last June, when traders snapping up penny stocks on the popular Robinhood app sought to defy decades of convention and make money on a bankrupt company.
&gt; 
&gt; Representatives for Knighthead, Certares and Warburg Pincus declined to comment, while Hertz, Dundon and Centerbridge didn’t immediately provide comment.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hertz shares soar above $4 on bankruptcy exit plans
&gt; The Knighthead-Certares group’s win brings the pandemic’s biggest Chapter 11 case nearer to a close, with Hertz seeking to exit court protection in June. Judge Mary Walrath must approve the final plan in Delaware bankruptcy court.
&gt; 
&gt; Investment firms have been dueling over ownership of Hertz for weeks, with both groups seeking to top the other with multiple rounds of proposals. An earlier Knighthead proposal valued Hertz’s equity at around $2.25 a share, with an enterprise value of $6.2 billion, Bloomberg previously reported.
&gt; 
&gt; As part of the winning plan, Apollo Global Management has committed $1.5 billion of preferred equity. Investors also would have the option to participate in a $1.6 billion rights offering.
&gt; 
&gt; The competition came amid surging demand for rentals and summer travel that has let many car renters raise prices while still leaving them without enough vehicles for customers to drive off the lot. Rival Avis Budget Group Inc. has seen its shares more than double this year.
&gt; 
&gt; Final proposals from both groups offered lenders and bondholders full repayment along with the share recovery, a relative rarity in bankruptcy proceedings. Hertz initially chose an iteration of the Centerbridge group’s plan, and Walrath last month approved a so-called breakup fee for those funds if they were later outbid.
&gt; 
&gt; Hertz sought bankruptcy protection in May 2020 when the near-total shutdown of the global travel industry sent its rental revenues plunging. Equity holders initially appeared to be wiped out, while junior bondholders were slated to take a haircut. Still, Hertz became a popular stock among day traders, who sent shares rocketing on optimism that they could defy the norms of bankruptcy court and win a payout. The stock frenzy even briefly helped the company fund its bankruptcy by selling new equity.
&gt; 
&gt; The case is Hertz Corp. 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

Can someone explain why its shares are not at $8 right now? This seems like an obvious arbitrage opportunity, but I assume I'm misunderstanding the situation.",1621474109,"Hertz has announced it will return $8 per share to shareholders—but the stock is only at $5.73From [bloomberg's article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/hertz-picks-knighthead-certares-offer-in-bankruptcy-auction):

&gt; Representatives for Knighthead, Certares and Warburg Pincus declined to comment, while Hertz, Dundon and Centerbridge didn’t immediately provide comment.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hertz shares soar above $4 on bankruptcy exit plans
&gt; The Knighthead-Certares group’s win brings the pandemic’s biggest Chapter 11 case nearer to a close, with Hertz seeking to exit court protection in June. Judge Mary Walrath must approve the final plan in Delaware bankruptcy court.
&gt; 
&gt; Investment firms have been dueling over ownership of Hertz for weeks, with both groups seeking to top the other with multiple rounds of proposals. An earlier Knighthead proposal valued Hertz’s equity at around $2.25 a share, with an enterprise value of $6.2 billion, Bloomberg previously reported.
&gt; 
&gt; As part of the winning plan, Apollo Global Management has committed $1.5 billion of preferred equity. Investors also would have the option to participate in a $1.6 billion rights offering.
&gt; 
&gt; The competition came amid surging demand for rentals and summer travel that has let many car renters raise prices while still leaving them without enough vehicles for customers to drive off the lot. Rival Avis Budget Group Inc. has seen its shares more than double this year.
&gt; 
&gt; Final proposals from both groups offered lenders and bondholders full repayment along with the share recovery, a relative rarity in bankruptcy proceedings. Hertz initially chose an iteration of the Centerbridge group’s plan, and Walrath last month approved a so-called breakup fee for those funds if they were later outbid.
&gt; 
&gt; Hertz sought bankruptcy protection in May 2020 when the near-total shutdown of the global travel industry sent its rental revenues plunging. Equity holders initially appeared to be wiped out, while junior bondholders were slated to take a haircut. Still, Hertz became a popular stock among day traders, who sent shares rocketing on optimism that they could defy the norms of bankruptcy court and win a payout. The stock frenzy even briefly helped the company fund its bankruptcy by selling new equity.
&gt; 
&gt; The case is Hertz Corp. 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

stocks,"Here is a Stock Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 19, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 19, 2021**

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week’s price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&amp;P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it’s stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn’t be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, “Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they’re not real currencies”. It’s important to note the statement doesn’t have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards.

“Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” ―Seneca",1621457696,"Here is a Stock Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 19, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 19, 2021**

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week’s price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&amp;P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it’s stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn’t be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, “Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they’re not real currencies”. It’s important to note the statement doesn’t have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining.

#Apple Inc


Ticker **$APPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 

The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 


At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.


With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.

But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher


This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.


An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 


Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 


While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 


This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.


This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 


Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 



**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards

I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes

TL;DR. APPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+). The range may be coming to an end.",1621456407,"APPLE INC.

stocks,"Can anyone explain why earnings no longer matter, and the entire market is just pump&amp;dump after pump&amp;dump?","I really don't understand this shit.

All the time now, a company performs well and the stock price drops because of it. Take Lowe's today for example. It blasted earnings. It literally doubled them. 8th earnings in a row it has smashed, and today it's down. Literally, you have a company coining it in, and the share price is dropping. (I dont own it btw, so this isn't a rant on that basis)

I know the argument is ""ThE WhoLE MaRkEt Is DoWn"". Sorry, no, I don't buy this bullshit.

Let's look at todays winners;

Advaxis is the 2nd biggest gainer today and is up 21%. It's a garbage fucking pennystock that trades at 0.58 cents. Even worse, it's a bullshit pharma stock. Normal volume is 6 million. Volume today - 166 million. There is no news to justify this interest

Mosys is the big winner so far, up 33%. Another bullshit $5 stock. Normal volume is 2 mil. No news, but today the volume is 30x the norm.

LifeMD has had lawsuits filed against it today, about claims its directors have comitted fraud. Even better;

**LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.**

So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 12%.

To end my rant, the 3rd placed highest today is another bullshit company, a Chinese medical company called Lianluo Smart. There's one single news article linking it to a takeover by newegg or something, the news article made little sense. Low and behold, normal volume is 400k, today it's 9 million. Even if the news is to be believed, this one single article was posted 1 hour ago, yet the price suddenly spiked 2 hours ago.

So, why do companies that do well, make money, smash earnings lose their stock value, and bullshit, nonsense companies get P&amp;D so much. This is a daily occurance. Every single day I see a new company increasing its share price by 50%+ and it's nonsense. I thought P&amp;D's were illegal.

AMD servers are 80% of the existing same-specification server fee, freeing up high-performance computing resources at an affordable price for enterprise customers.
AMD servers can be applied to a variety of business applications, including the general web, middleware, as well as databases and big data analytics.
Existing systems can also be easily migrated to industry-standard x86 architectures, making them suitable for customers who need better performance for the price.  KT's self-validation shows that AMD servers perform at the same level as Intel server CPU cascades operating on the KT Cloud D1 platform. As a result, enterprise customers preparing for large-scale deployments are expected to significantly reduce their total cost of ownership (TCO) by utilizing AMD servers.  AMD servers are available on the D1 platform in the KT Cloud, which is more secure and flexible than regular public cloud zone. After launch, the company plans to continue to expand not only the D1 platform, but also kt G-Cloud and F-Cloud.  The D1 platform is built with physical security equipment such as IPS, firewalls, and VPNs for excellent security stability.  In addition, up to 15 DMZ and private networks can be flexibly created, and all network and firewall policies can be easily set up within the cloud console. In addition to servers of the same specifications as previous servers, they also offer high-spec servers with up to 128vCore x 256GB of memory.

Commenting on the annual results, Michael Haack, President and CEO, said, “Across all measures, fiscal 2021 was extraordinary for Eagle as we met and overcame challenges that were inconceivable just a year earlier. The resilience of our business model, our financial discipline and our team’s operational and strategic execution allowed us to deliver record financial results, integrate the largest acquisition in the Company’s history and further streamline our business portfolio by divesting several non-core businesses, all while achieving industry leading safety performance. Our strong operating cash flow enabled us to reduce leverage to under 1.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA, providing us with significant liquidity and increased financial flexibility.”

Mr. Haack continued, “As we begin our new fiscal year, Eagle is well-positioned, both geographically and financially, with ample raw material reserves to capitalize on the underlying demand fundamentals that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity growth over the near and long-term. We remain confident in Eagle’s prospects for continued growth and sustainable value creation for all shareholders.”

Mr. Haack concluded, “I want to thank our dedicated employees for their exceptional efforts and focus during this unprecedented time. We have a long history of managing through challenging market conditions, and we have once again shown the benefits of our business model as we navigated through this unpredictable year.”

Decision to Remain a Combined Company

Eagle’s Board of Directors has decided not to pursue the proposed separation of Eagle Materials into two independent, publicly traded companies at this time. Much has transpired since the announcement of the proposed separation that has caused the Board to reevaluate the separation’s merits:

First, the size and financial strength of the combined Company, with its diversified asset base and geographical footprint and its robust balance sheet, have provided great comfort, stability and value to our shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers during an unprecedented and uncertain time.
Second, given the continued consolidation of the industries in which we participate and the Company’s rigorous examination of a number of strategic alternatives since the announcement of the proposed separation, it has become clear that a combined company with greater financial scale and flexibility will be better positioned to pursue key strategic growth options and enhance shareholder value.
Third, since the announcement of the proposed separation, the Company has streamlined its business portfolio including the divestiture of its Oil and Gas Proppants business and other non-core assets.
Mike Nicolais, Chairman of the Board, commented, “Eagle is exceedingly well-positioned and is performing as well as at any time in its history. Both major business segments continue to post industry leading results on just about every measure. As a shareholder, I could not be more pleased with the position of the combined Company. While the Board will continue to evaluate the merits of a separation on a periodic basis, it has concluded, in consultation with external advisors, that the combined Company is in the best position to create long-term shareholder value.”

Capital Allocation Priorities

Eagle remains dedicated to a disciplined capital allocation process to enhance shareholder value. Consistent with our track record, our allocation priorities remain unchanged: 1. Growth investments that meet our strict financial return standards and are consistent with our strategic focus; 2. Operating capital investments to maintain and strengthen our low-cost producer positions; 3. Return excess cash to shareholders, primarily through our share repurchase program.

In the past three years, we have invested nearly $700 million in acquisitions, $303 million in organic capital expenditures and $626 million in share repurchases and dividends. At March 31, 2021, nearly 7.3 million shares remain under the current repurchase authorization.

Reinstatement and Increase of Quarterly Cash Dividend

Eagle’s Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, payable on July 16, 2021, to stockholders of record of its Common Stock at the close of business on June 18, 2021. The reinstated quarterly dividend represents a 150% increase from the quarterly dividend in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mike Nicolais commented, “The reinstatement of our quarterly dividend reflects Eagle’s strong operational and financial performance, our confidence in the resilience of the business, and our commitment to reward shareholders, while preserving the financial flexibility to continue to grow Eagle and create long-term shareholder value.”

Financial Results

Heavy Materials: Cement, Concrete and Aggregates

Fiscal 2021 revenue in the Heavy Materials sector, which includes Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, as well as Joint Venture and intersegment Cement revenue, was $1.1 billion, a 19% improvement. Heavy Materials annual operating earnings increased 27% to $253.0 million primarily because of improved Cement net sales prices and earnings from the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business.

Fiscal 2021 Cement revenue, including Joint Venture and intersegment revenue, was up 26% to $944.6 million, and Cement operating earnings increased 29% to $234.0 million. The annual revenue and earnings improvements reflect higher sales volume and net sales prices as well as the significant contribution of the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business, which added approximately $176 million of revenue and $34 million of operating earnings during the year.

The average annual net Cement sales price for the year increased 1% to $111.19 per ton. Organic (not including the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business) average net Cement sales prices increased 3%. Cement sales volume for the year was a record 7.5 million tons, up 26%. Organic annual Cement sales volume increased 1%.

Fourth quarter Cement revenue, including Joint Venture and intersegment revenue, was up 17% to $171.0 million. Excluding the results of the recently acquired Kosmos Cement Business, revenue was down 1%. Operating earnings decreased 6% to $23.2 million. Eagle’s fourth quarter Cement earnings were affected by a severe winter storm during February 2021 which had a significant impact on Texas and the broader Southern United States. Our cement facilities in Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma were forced to curtail production during the storm and energy prices spiked during this time period. We estimate the storm’s impact on Cement operating earnings was approximately $6 million primarily due to higher costs during the quarter. We are still engaged in discussions with contractual counterparties regarding the responsibility for certain charges and obligations arising as a result of the storm, and therefore, it is not possible at the present time to make a final determination as to the storm’s impact on our financial results.

The average net Cement sales price for the quarter increased 2% to $112.77 per ton. Organic average net Cement sales prices increased 3%. Cement sales volume for the quarter was up 17% to a record 1.4 million tons. Organic quarterly Cement sales volume declined 2% to 1.1 million tons.

Fiscal 2021 revenue from Concrete and Aggregates decreased 7% to $168.7 million because of the divestiture of our northern California concrete and aggregates businesses during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Concrete and Aggregates reported fiscal 2021 operating earnings of $19.1 million, up 9%, reflecting improved organic sales volume and pricing as well as operating efficiencies, including lower diesel fuel costs.

Fourth quarter Concrete and Aggregates revenue was $34.8 million, a decrease of 12%, because of the divestiture of our northern California concrete and aggregates businesses. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $3.3 million, a 30% increase, reflecting improved sales volume and pricing and improved operating efficiencies.

Light Materials: Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard

Fiscal 2021 revenue in the Light Materials sector, which includes Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard, increased 5%, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing. Gypsum Wallboard annual sales volume was a record 2.9 billion square feet (BSF), up 6%, while the average Gypsum Wallboard net sales price increased 1% to $149.62 per MSF. Given the improved demand outlook for single-family construction activity in the US and increasing demand for our products, we implemented wallboard price increases during the second half of our fiscal year. We also announced a wallboard price increase for early April 2021.

Fiscal 2021 operating earnings were $192.8 million, an increase of 2%, driven by improved sales volume and pricing, partially offset by increased operating cost, primarily due to higher recycled fiber costs and startup costs associated with our paper mill expansion.

Fourth quarter Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard revenue increased 15% to $176.9 million, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing. Gypsum Wallboard sales volume increased 3% to 706 million square feet (MMSF), while the average Gypsum Wallboard net sales price increased 10% to $161.07 per MSF.

Paperboard sales volume for the quarter increased 4% to a record 82,000 tons. The average Paperboard net sales price for the fourth quarter was $481.40 per ton, up 5%, consistent with the pricing provisions in our long-term sales agreements.

Fourth quarter operating earnings in the sector were $52.4 million, an increase of 15%, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing partially offset by the impact of the winter storm in February 2021. Our Oklahoma paper mill was forced to curtail production during the week of the storm and also experienced higher energy costs during the shutdown. Additionally, our wallboard shipments were significantly affected by the harsh winter conditions. We estimate the storm affected fourth quarter Light Materials operating earnings by approximately $6 million. We are still engaged in discussions with contractual counterparties regarding the responsibility for certain charges and obligations arising as a result of the storm, and therefore, it is not possible at the present time to make a final determination as to the storm’s impact on our financial results. Although the operating earnings of our Light Materials sector were adversely affected by the storm, we were able to curtail some of our operations and release a portion of our natural gas commitments to third parties in a timely manner. The release of these commitments contributed to a significant increase in Other Non-Operating Income in the fourth quarter.

Sale of Oil and Gas Proppants Business

On September 18, 2020, the Company sold its Oil and Gas Proppants business to Smart Sand, Inc. The current-year and prior-year financial results of the Oil and Gas Proppants segment have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the Statement of Earnings. The assets and liabilities of the Oil and Gas Proppants segment have been reflected on separate lines for Discontinued Operations on the Balance Sheet.

Details of Financial Results

We conduct one of our cement plant operations through a 50/50 joint venture, Texas Lehigh Cement Company LP (the Joint Venture). We use the equity method of accounting for our 50% interest in the Joint Venture. For segment reporting purposes only, we proportionately consolidate our 50% share of the Joint Venture’s revenue and operating earnings, which is consistent with the way management organizes the segments within Eagle for making operating decisions and assessing performance.

In addition, for segment reporting purposes, we report intersegment revenue as a part of a segment’s total revenue. Intersegment sales are eliminated on the consolidated statement of earnings. Refer to Attachment 3 for a reconciliation of these amounts.

Our cement facilities in Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma were forced to curtail production during the storm and energy prices spiked during this time period. We estimate the storm’s impact on Cement operating earnings was approximately $6 million primarily due to higher costs during the quarter. We are still engaged in discussions with contractual counterparties regarding the responsibility for certain charges and obligations arising as a result of the storm, and therefore, it is not possible at the present time to make a final determination as to the storm’s impact on our financial results.

The average net Cement sales price for the quarter increased 2% to $112.77 per ton. Organic average net Cement sales prices increased 3%. Cement sales volume for the quarter was up 17% to a record 1.4 million tons. Organic quarterly Cement sales volume declined 2% to 1.1 million tons.

Fiscal 2021 revenue from Concrete and Aggregates decreased 7% to $168.7 million because of the divestiture of our northern California concrete and aggregates businesses during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Concrete and Aggregates reported fiscal 2021 operating earnings of $19.1 million, up 9%, reflecting improved organic sales volume and pricing as well as operating efficiencies, including lower diesel fuel costs.

Fourth quarter Concrete and Aggregates revenue was $34.8 million, a decrease of 12%, because of the divestiture of our northern California concrete and aggregates businesses. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $3.3 million, a 30% increase, reflecting improved sales volume and pricing and improved operating efficiencies.

Light Materials: Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard

Fiscal 2021 revenue in the Light Materials sector, which includes Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard, increased 5%, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing. Gypsum Wallboard annual sales volume was a record 2.9 billion square feet (BSF), up 6%, while the average Gypsum Wallboard net sales price increased 1% to $149.62 per MSF. Given the improved demand outlook for single-family construction activity in the US and increasing demand for our products, we implemented wallboard price increases during the second half of our fiscal year. We also announced a wallboard price increase for early April 2021.

Fiscal 2021 operating earnings were $192.8 million, an increase of 2%, driven by improved sales volume and pricing, partially offset by increased operating cost, primarily due to higher recycled fiber costs and startup costs associated with our paper mill expansion.

Fourth quarter Gypsum Wallboard and Paperboard revenue increased 15% to $176.9 million, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing. Gypsum Wallboard sales volume increased 3% to 706 million square feet (MMSF), while the average Gypsum Wallboard net sales price increased 10% to $161.07 per MSF.

Paperboard sales volume for the quarter increased 4% to a record 82,000 tons. The average Paperboard net sales price for the fourth quarter was $481.40 per ton, up 5%, consistent with the pricing provisions in our long-term sales agreements.

Fourth quarter operating earnings in the sector were $52.4 million, an increase of 15%, reflecting improved Wallboard sales volume and pricing partially offset by the impact of the winter storm in February 2021. Our Oklahoma paper mill was forced to curtail production during the week of the storm and also experienced higher energy costs during the shutdown. Additionally, our wallboard shipments were significantly affected by the harsh winter conditions. We estimate the storm affected fourth quarter Light Materials operating earnings by approximately $6 million. We are still engaged in discussions with contractual counterparties regarding the responsibility for certain charges and obligations arising as a result of the storm, and therefore, it is not possible at the present time to make a final determination as to the storm’s impact on our financial results. Although the operating earnings of our Light Materials sector were adversely affected by the storm, we were able to curtail some of our operations and release a portion of our natural gas commitments to third parties in a timely manner. The release of these commitments contributed to a significant increase in Other Non-Operating Income in the fourth quarter.

Palantir may have fallen victim to the high-growth tech sell-off, but TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon sees an opportunity to add to his position.

The software-as-a-service stock is down 10% this year, well underperforming the broader market.

Gordon sees success ahead for Palantir as a company, and subsequent outperformance for its stock, noting one overlooked area of the company’s operations.

“This is an aspect of the business that not a lot of people talk about and that was that they were a key player in the Covid battle. Medical suppliers used the Palantir software to monitor global supply chains and then they helped to measure shortages and imbalances of supplies and proactively move those supplies around to meet the demand,” Gordon told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday, specifically pointing to the success of vaccine rollouts in the U.S. and U.K.

Palantir generates the bulk of its revenue through government contracts. Its government segment makes up nearly 56% of total sales with commercial as the remainder.

Recent positions from some of Wall Street’s most notable players also support Gordon’s bull case. Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office recently disclosed a new stake of nearly 6 million shares of Palantir, while Cathy Wood’s ARK Invest also holds a position.

Its technical position also looks set up for a push higher, Gordon said.

“Technically speaking here, you can see there’s been a pretty unbelievable run ever since they came to the market, rallied all the way up to $44, and then what you see here is a pretty common three-wave technical correction,” he said.

The triangle formed by that middle wave of the correction suggests to Gordon that the stock could break out to the upside.

To take advantage of that move, Gordon lays out one potential trade – putting on a 25/30 call debit spread with Aug. 20 expiration. A move up to $30, the higher end of that spread, implies more than 40% upside from its Tuesday close above $21.",1621431702,"CNBC | One area of success investors may overlook when it comes to Palantir stockhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/palantir-stock-trader-lays-out-bullish-case-for-software-company.html?&amp;qsearchterm=palantir

stocks,Lumber DD: Ignore the Misinformation/Clickbait. The actual price of lumber is still RISING and data shows future demand still very high.,"The amount bullshit or selective use of statistics by the clickbait headlines and the bears on social media is pissing me off so I’m doing another post to help those who follow me sift through the bullshit.  When evaluating your investment decisions (whether you want to short lumber or go long, I don’t personally care which your preference is) it is important you understand what is actually going on, what some of these terms actually mean and what inferences can *actually* be drawn from the data.  If you go by what the clickbait out there is feeding you, you will likely get burned.

**Western SPF lumber *futures* ARE NOT the same as current Lumber *Prices* **

The lumber futures contracts traded in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are futures contracts for a very specific type of dimensional lumber: Western SPF KD 2x4 #2&amp;Btr.  It is not the current price of “lumber” that wholesalers or builders are currently paying this week for new orders.  Nor is it a predictor of what lumber will be at the month of expiration. [For example, here’s a screenshot from ~ first week of February 2021 showing the price of futures when Western SPF cash prices were about $950.](https://imgur.com/a/GQOfvFD)  It is simply a helpful indicator.

There are many different types of lumber products that sell at many different prices.  If you are not using the CME to trade WSPF futures, it is simply one of many data points to be used to assess the general state of the industry.  It is not always an accurate reflection of the current price of lumber.  (It may be important to Google “Backwardation vs Contago” before you start drawing inferences on these futures price patterns.)

The cash or “Spot” market is what builders/wholesalers buying from the mills are paying RIGHT NOW for the new orders of lumber.  So when you here Lumber twitter talking about spot price, they are talking about cash prices right now.

The Random Lengths composite number is another cash price indicator; an average price of the main various types of dimensional lumber being sold that week.  It is the closest thing to a single price of dimensional lumber out there.  BTW, the Composite is up this week (~$1500 USD), and it was up last week.

The main lumber spot prices are also updated every week by Madison’s lumber Report.  You have to pay to get access to their reports, same with Random Length’s composite.  But sometimes you’ll get free posts, like this one: [Madison’s Lumber Reporter](https://madisonsreport.com/).  Also you can get people on Lumber twitter posting where cash markets are for the day, like the tweet up above.

**Is the Price of Lumber Crashing?  NO! Or not yet at least**

Let me start by saying, Lumber is not sustainable at $1400-$1600 mbf.  No one in the industry wants lumber that high because it is not sustainable. Lumber prices need a healthy correction, sooner rather than later.  

That being said, there’s been a lot of chicken littles panicking and bears celebrating because the lumber futures market has been limit down from 1700 to ~1200 in the last week.  THIS IS NOT THE PRICE OF LUMBER.  The spot price of lumber HAS NOT dropped steadily for the last seven days. (See Madison Report) [https://imgur.com/a/WArizXg].  In fact it has been rising, and is projected to CONTINUE to rise in the short term due to demand. [Go to the last section of this Bloomberg Article for a sensible discussion of Lumber’s immediate future]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/plunge-in-lumber-contracts-signals-turning-point-for-wood-rally)

Will the cash drop at some point? YES.  Does it need to drop? YES! It probably is not sustainable long term on these prices and we want the industry to do well for years; not months.  Even if lumber dropped 50% from its current cash price (~$1500 USD) to ~$750, and then that became a new base for the next few years, those years would be the best years in industry history, other than 2021.   

**So why are lumber futures crashing if price isn’t?**

I don’t know for certain, but likely a combination of things.  With the surge in prices, speculators piled into the futures market and drove up the price, hit and top and then surged out.  Now we are seeing a bit of capitulation. (google it).  With that run up, apparently there was [a bit of a short squeeze on lumber]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-lumber-trader-stinson-dean-164741704.html) that is now over.  Also, the futures market very recently increased the margin requirements, which may have further pushed out some speculators.  Now we have a big drop, maybe healthy overcorrection, and these futures will get back to reasonable backwardation.

**Implications for the Lumber Stocks**

For those considering liquidating shares or buying puts on lumber right now, context is very important.  Go look at historical price of lumber.  Current July futures has dropped all the way to $1250 mfb (USD).  If the average price of dimensional lumber drops all the way to ~$800-900 mbf (USD) which is still another 30% drop from current Futures price, and if lumber remained that way for a year, **it would be the best year in the industry’s history.**  

These lumber companies’ stock prices are currently valued at an annual lumber runrate of $500-$550 and are sitting at about the same as their 2018 stock price which had an average price of ~$500 mbf USD for the year. This post is not about debating what that means for future value and I am not telling you what to do, but it is an important consideration regardless of what your perspective is on these cyclicals.

**But CNBC said housing starts had a HUGE drop. So doesn’t that mean demand is cratering due to high prices? NO!**

I literally saw this question on twitter and facepalmed.  April housing start data was released today.  Everyone had their spin on it.  Clickbait sources added dramatic language to make it sound like everything is crashing because it fits the fear mongering narrative.  

Let’s look at it from both sides and see what it actually says and what it doesn’t’ say. Here’s the US Census link so you can read it yourself. [Link](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf)  Here’s the Wellsfargo link with a better breakdown. [Link](https://externalcontent.blob.core.windows.net/pdfs/pdfs/8173fa2e-3b8d-4239-bce0-b34b022d540a.pdf)

**The Basic Numbers**

US Housing starts for April 2021 came out to an annual rate of 1.569 million housing units.  That is a 9% decrease from the annualized rate in March 2021, which was 1.733 million.  However it also was a **67% increase** from the prior year April 2020 which was 938K housing starts. 

Obviously comparing to April 2020 can give a misleading impression of current trends given what was going on back then.   I added it because CNBC, the other media outlets and Inflation-Twitter used the year-over-year metric from the CPI numbers in order to more effectively push the fear-mongering inflation narrative. Whereas now they back to the MoM metric in order to get the most clicks.  

US Housing permit numbers are up to annual rate of 1.76 million; a slight increase (.3%) from March’s permit numbers and a 61% increase from April 2020.  

Single Family housing starts (which consume the most lumber) were down 13.4% from March 2021.  Multi-Family homes were up at 470K.  Single Family home completions for April 2021 were at a rate of 1.045 million; a .1% increase over March 2020.

**Is the Sky Falling? No or not yet anyways.**

Housing starts are down from the prior month and it was unexpected.  That absolutely can be the beginning of a headwind forming for the homebuilders and lumber stocks.  Frankly, it is quite possible we will see even more decline in housing starts in the May numbers that will be released in June.  But in reality, until we are seeing multiple straight months of substantial declining housing starts, then it’s just noise.  

Yes, there are anecdotal stories of developers throttling back due to lack of supplies or uncertainty in prices. This data is consistent with those preliminary reports.  However, there’s also a massive amount of anecdotal evidence pointing in the opposite direction. [Like this great example of a national homebuilder reporting they have sold out all of there spec homes AND lots in NC!!!]( https://twitter.com/MattBrubakerNC/status/1394787807978311680)

This report was a hiccup and unexpected, but this report had a massive amount of silver linings, when you factor in the context, none of which are really acknowledged by the clickbait articles or social media.

**So WHY are housing starts down then?**

Well, the clickbait implies it’s from Lumber prices, along with other commodity prices.  While that may be the case for a small percentage of the smaller builders/contractors, that thesis doesn’t make sense when you look at the big picture.  

1) When lumber jumped ~300% over the course of 2020 and early 2021, that appeared to have literally no impact on the rate of housing starts.  To the contrary, building rates increased during this time!  All of a sudden that 67% increase in starts YoY becomes a bit more relevant…  The idea that the price increases from March to April all of a sudden caused a 13% drop in single family homes, while demand still surged, is silly.

2) The social/clickbait medias literally ran these EXACT same headlines in February when the January housing numbers dropped ~6% from December’s numbers.  “HOUSING STARTS DOWN AMIDST A SURGE IN LUMBER PRICES.” It sells and is easy for people to understand, but correlation does not equal causation.  Shark attacks increase in the US when Ice cream sales go up.  Does that mean one causes the other? No.  It means both increase during the summer when more people are eating ice cream and swimming in the ocean due to the heat.  Same principle applies here with these housing starts numbers and the futures surge.

The reality is **the builders simply don’t have sufficient supplies or labor** to sustain that build rate (1.7 mill annual starts) right now, and apparently there were some weather issues in the south as well.  [Wells Fargo Article discussing exactly this](https://externalcontent.blob.core.windows.net/pdfs/pdfs/8173fa2e-3b8d-4239-bce0-b34b022d540a.pdf).  In other words, housing starts are mostly constrained by what we have supplies to build which shouldn’t really surprise anyone given the next point:

**April housing starts were at or close to the NA Lumber Industry’s max production capacity**

West Fraser recently put out a presentation on the status of North America’s current lumber [production capacity in terms of housing starts from 2020 data.  [Here’s the Link of the graph](https://imgur.com/a/uQhI6V4).  Based on data from the FEA and NAHB, by the end of 2020, North America really only had the ability to produce lumber for about ~1.5 million housing starts a year.  The lumbers mills are working to improve efficiencies, and maybe that number has gone up a bit (maybe 5-10% by end of the year?).  But nothing major because it takes multiple years to build sawmills and get them operational.  

So what does that mean?  From another angle, April’s housing start numbers are essentially at NA’s current lumber production capacity despite these records prices.  [Probably why the lumber companies were reporting bullish new like this only two weeks ago.]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sawmills-selling-boards-faster-cut-142931825.html)  Not exactly a great indicator of an imminent crash in lumber prices *to pre pandemic levels* which is what certain people online want you to think is about to happen.  

**Immediate Future Outlook Also Shows High Demand**

The housing permits increase, despite the surge in lumber prices, shows that builder sentiment is still overall positive and there is even more demand in line waiting for lumber.  The major home builders have passed on the costs to consumers with little problem so far. This is a strong support for the “higher for longer” crowd who have been predicting lumber will stay at historically high margins for longer than 2021 Q2 (which ends in 6 weeks…).

To get some historical context on how much pent-up supply-constrained home construction demand we have: The proportion of authorized housing construction which haven’t begun construction yet is now at the highest level since 1979. [Link](https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1394638539900469252)  That’s a lot of people waiting in line outside the venue, trying to get in.  Would you expect concert ticket prices to drop when there’s a line half-mile long outside the venue…?  

You can also review Chief Economist/Housing Market Expert [Ali Wolf’s twitter feed](https://twitter.com/AliWolfEcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for non-stop anecdotes and stats demonstrating how the new housing market is STILL booming despite these high lumber costs. 

**2020’s Biggest Driver of Lumber Demand Projected to Keep Growing**

According to FEA and other trade groups, the biggest end-use of lumber in 2020 was the renovation sector. [Link to Graphic](https://imgur.com/a/qxsP0i6).  Anecdotally, a lot of people have been saying that they will delay projects because lumber costs too much.  And a bunch of Youtube “economists/investigative journalists” like to go to Home Depot or Lumber yards to show all the wood still there (as if that were valid field research) and cry conspiracy.  And it makes sense that with more people returning to work and the economy reopening that DIY would go down.  

However, the Joint Center for Housing Studies at this place called Harvard University (America’s favorite safety school?) has projected the opposite. [link to study] (https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/press-releases/remodeling-upturn-carry-2022).  While they acknowledge that the smaller DIY projects and renovations are tapering off, the larger professional jobs are picking up.  Demand will stay were it is for the rest of the year and then likely pick up even more in Q1 2022.  It is partly due to jobs that were put off during the pandemic closures, but also from people making more investments in their home because of the current housing market. 

Also, the Home Depot CFO also confirmed that from their side, they are still seeing strong demand on the renovation side from their end and don't expect it to drop any time soon. [Link to earnings call transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/18/home-depot-hd-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)  

Takeaway, I have no doubt that there has been some decrease in demand for lumber from the DIY crowd, but that the drop in demand isn’t as bad as youtube makes it look like and any demand that fell from DIYers is likely being covered by demand from another source: the professional renovations. 

**But isn’t this 2005 all over again thus crash imminent? Not Yet**

There are some things that this housing market has in common with 2005/2006.  But there are also many things that this market does not have in common.  I am not going to get into the differences in the health of the financial markets vs now.  They are different.  A large portions of the home loans are sub-prime mortgage loans.  If you have credible data to the contrary, please share.  

Also, I am not trying to suggest that housing will stay on it’s current manic trajectory.  The housing market is not healthy and at some point it will slow down dramatically or it will correct.  But that’s probably not happening in the next couple months.

From a Supply/Demand standpoint, 2005/2006 are extremely different from today.  Is the housing market manic right now? Yes.  Prices are rocketing up like crazy, similar to ‘05/’06. However, the fundamentals driving this housing market surge is different.   

Inventory of available homes is dramatically different.  In 2005/2006, home prices were shooting through the roof even though the inventory of available homes was also shooting up. [Link to graphic](https://imgur.com/a/bZwtnqd).  On top of that, the US was at an annualized rate of ~2.1 million home starts in 2005.  

So the market was *flooded* with new homes on top of existing available inventory.  For awhile people kept paying more and more for those homes, ignoring the basic economic principle of supply/demand.  However, we have the opposite problem now: there aren’t enough homes to go around.  We are currently at a record low supply of homes compared to demand/population.  So, from that perspective, there is at least a rational basis for the price to soar: scarcity.  Something that wasn’t present then.

The same thing difference exists for lumber supply capacity in NA.  In 2005/2006, NA lumber production/capacity was around ~75 billion board feet.  Current production capacity at end of 2020 was just under 60 billion Board feet. [Link for Graphic](https://imgur.com/a/31E3Aue).  The industry plans to increase its capacity by making some new mills right now, but that will taking another year or more and it’s nothing dramatic that will substantially change the calculus in the next 1-2 years.

So unlike 2005, while the surge in home prices is similar to 2005, the market conditions causing that price surge are fundamentally different, so it is unclear if any credible inferences can be drawn from that time period in assessing our current cycle.

**TLDR:** There are a bunch of morons out there throwing around terms they don’t understand and drawing conclusions that aren’t supported by the larger datasets.  Lumber prices are still rising, even though futures are dropping.  The cash price of lumber WILL correct this summer, but likely not to pre pandemic levels. Make sure you do your homework before making investment decisions regarding housing/lumber.  I am not a financial advisor.    

If anyone identifies flaws in the analysis, please share.  I’d really like to know if I’m missing something here because when I go online and read the commentary, I feel like I am taking crazy pills.

The actual price of lumber is still RISING and data shows future demand still very high.The amount bullshit or selective use of statistics by the clickbait headlines and the bears on social media is pissing me off so I’m doing another post to help those who follow me sift through the bullshit.  When evaluating your investment decisions (whether you want to short lumber or go long, I don’t personally care which your preference is) it is important you understand what is actually going on, what some of these terms actually mean and what inferences can *actually* be drawn from the data.  If you go by what the clickbait out there is feeding you, you will likely get burned.

**Western SPF lumber *futures* ARE NOT the same as current Lumber *Prices* **

The lumber futures contracts traded in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are futures contracts for a very specific type of dimensional lumber: Western SPF KD 2x4 #2&amp;Btr.  It is not the current price of “lumber” that wholesalers or builders are currently paying this week for new orders.  Nor is it a predictor of what lumber will be at the month of expiration. [For example, here’s a screenshot from ~ first week of February 2021 showing the price of futures when Western SPF cash prices were about $950.](https://imgur.com/a/GQOfvFD)  It is simply a helpful indicator.

There are many different types of lumber products that sell at many different prices.  If you are not using the CME to trade WSPF futures, it is simply one of many data points to be used to assess the general state of the industry.  It is not always an accurate reflection of the current price of lumber.  (It may be important to Google “Backwardation vs Contago” before you start drawing inferences on these futures price patterns.)

The cash or “Spot” market is what builders/wholesalers buying from the mills are paying RIGHT NOW for the new orders of lumber.  So when you here Lumber twitter talking about spot price, they are talking about cash prices right now.

The Random Lengths composite number is another cash price indicator; an average price of the main various types of dimensional lumber being sold that week.  It is the closest thing to a single price of dimensional lumber out there.  BTW, the Composite is up this week (~$1500 USD), and it was up last week.

The main lumber spot prices are also updated every week by Madison’s lumber Report.  You have to pay to get access to their reports, same with Random Length’s composite.  But sometimes you’ll get free posts, like this one: [Madison’s Lumber Reporter](https://madisonsreport.com/).  Also you can get people on Lumber twitter posting where cash markets are for the day, like the tweet up above.

**Is the Price of Lumber Crashing?  NO! Or not yet at least**

Let me start by saying, Lumber is not sustainable at $1400-$1600 mbf.  No one in the industry wants lumber that high because it is not sustainable. Lumber prices need a healthy correction, sooner rather than later.  

That being said, there’s been a lot of chicken littles panicking and bears celebrating because the lumber futures market has been limit down from 1700 to ~1200 in the last week.  THIS IS NOT THE PRICE OF LUMBER.  The spot price of lumber HAS NOT dropped steadily for the last seven days. (See Madison Report) [https://imgur.com/a/WArizXg].  In fact it has been rising, and is projected to CONTINUE to rise in the short term due to demand. [Go to the last section of this Bloomberg Article for a sensible discussion of Lumber’s immediate future]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/plunge-in-lumber-contracts-signals-turning-point-for-wood-rally)

Will the cash drop at some point? YES.  Does it need to drop? YES! It probably is not sustainable long term on these prices and we want the industry to do well for years; not months.  Even if lumber dropped 50% from its current cash price (~$1500 USD) to ~$750, and then that became a new base for the next few years, those years would be the best years in industry history, other than 2021.   

**So why are lumber futures crashing if price isn’t?**

I don’t know for certain, but likely a combination of things.  With the surge in prices, speculators piled into the futures market and drove up the price, hit and top and then surged out.  Now we are seeing a bit of capitulation. (google it).  With that run up, apparently there was [a bit of a short squeeze on lumber]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-lumber-trader-stinson-dean-164741704.html) that is now over.  Also, the futures market very recently increased the margin requirements, which may have further pushed out some speculators.  Now we have a big drop, maybe healthy overcorrection, and these futures will get back to reasonable backwardation.

**Implications for the Lumber Stocks**

For those considering liquidating shares or buying puts on lumber right now, context is very important.  Go look at historical price of lumber.  Current July futures has dropped all the way to $1250 mfb (USD).  If the average price of dimensional lumber drops all the way to ~$800-900 mbf (USD) which is still another 30% drop from current Futures price, and if lumber remained that way for a year, **it would be the best year in the industry’s history.**  

These lumber companies’ stock prices are currently valued at an annual lumber runrate of $500-$550 and are sitting at about the same as their 2018 stock price which had an average price of ~$500 mbf USD for the year. This post is not about debating what that means for future value and I am not telling you what to do, but it is an important consideration regardless of what your perspective is on these cyclicals.

**But CNBC said housing starts had a HUGE drop. So doesn’t that mean demand is cratering due to high prices? NO!**

I literally saw this question on twitter and facepalmed.  April housing start data was released today.  Everyone had their spin on it.  Clickbait sources added dramatic language to make it sound like everything is crashing because it fits the fear mongering narrative.  

Let’s look at it from both sides and see what it actually says and what it doesn’t’ say. Here’s the US Census link so you can read it yourself. [Link](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf)  Here’s the Wellsfargo link with a better breakdown. [Link](https://externalcontent.blob.core.windows.net/pdfs/pdfs/8173fa2e-3b8d-4239-bce0-b34b022d540a.pdf)

**The Basic Numbers**

US Housing starts for April 2021 came out to an annual rate of 1.569 million housing units.  That is a 9% decrease from the annualized rate in March 2021, which was 1.733 million.  However it also was a **67% increase** from the prior year April 2020 which was 938K housing starts. 

Obviously comparing to April 2020 can give a misleading impression of current trends given what was going on back then.   I added it because CNBC, the other media outlets and Inflation-Twitter used the year-over-year metric from the CPI numbers in order to more effectively push the fear-mongering inflation narrative. Whereas now they back to the MoM metric in order to get the most clicks.  

US Housing permit numbers are up to annual rate of 1.76 million; a slight increase (.3%) from March’s permit numbers and a 61% increase from April 2020.  

Single Family housing starts (which consume the most lumber) were down 13.4% from March 2021.  Multi-Family homes were up at 470K.  Single Family home completions for April 2021 were at a rate of 1.045 million; a .1% increase over March 2020.

**Is the Sky Falling? No or not yet anyways.**

Housing starts are down from the prior month and it was unexpected.  That absolutely can be the beginning of a headwind forming for the homebuilders and lumber stocks.  Frankly, it is quite possible we will see even more decline in housing starts in the May numbers that will be released in June.  But in reality, until we are seeing multiple straight months of substantial declining housing starts, then it’s just noise.  

Yes, there are anecdotal stories of developers throttling back due to lack of supplies or uncertainty in prices. This data is consistent with those preliminary reports.  However, there’s also a massive amount of anecdotal evidence pointing in the opposite direction. [Like this great example of a national homebuilder reporting they have sold out all of there spec homes AND lots in NC!!!]( https://twitter.com/MattBrubakerNC/status/1394787807978311680)

This report was a hiccup and unexpected, but this report had a massive amount of silver linings, when you factor in the context, none of which are really acknowledged by the clickbait articles or social media.

**So WHY are housing starts down then?**

Well, the clickbait implies it’s from Lumber prices, along with other commodity prices.  While that may be the case for a small percentage of the smaller builders/contractors, that thesis doesn’t make sense when you look at the big picture.  

1) When lumber jumped ~300% over the course of 2020 and early 2021, that appeared to have literally no impact on the rate of housing starts.  To the contrary, building rates increased during this time!  All of a sudden that 67% increase in starts YoY becomes a bit more relevant…  The idea that the price increases from March to April all of a sudden caused a 13% drop in single family homes, while demand still surged, is silly.

2) The social/clickbait medias literally ran these EXACT same headlines in February when the January housing numbers dropped ~6% from December’s numbers.  “HOUSING STARTS DOWN AMIDST A SURGE IN LUMBER PRICES.” It sells and is easy for people to understand, but correlation does not equal causation.  Shark attacks increase in the US when Ice cream sales go up.  Does that mean one causes the other? No.  It means both increase during the summer when more people are eating ice cream and swimming in the ocean due to the heat.  Same principle applies here with these housing starts numbers and the futures surge.

The reality is **the builders simply don’t have sufficient supplies or labor** to sustain that build rate (1.7 mill annual starts) right now, and apparently there were some weather issues in the south as well.  [Wells Fargo Article discussing exactly this](https://externalcontent.blob.core.windows.net/pdfs/pdfs/8173fa2e-3b8d-4239-bce0-b34b022d540a.pdf).  In other words, housing starts are mostly constrained by what we have supplies to build which shouldn’t really surprise anyone given the next point:

**April housing starts were at or close to the NA Lumber Industry’s max production capacity**

West Fraser recently put out a presentation on the status of North America’s current lumber [production capacity in terms of housing starts from 2020 data.  [Here’s the Link of the graph](https://imgur.com/a/uQhI6V4).  Based on data from the FEA and NAHB, by the end of 2020, North America really only had the ability to produce lumber for about ~1.5 million housing starts a year.  The lumbers mills are working to improve efficiencies, and maybe that number has gone up a bit (maybe 5-10% by end of the year?).  But nothing major because it takes multiple years to build sawmills and get them operational.  

So what does that mean?  From another angle, April’s housing start numbers are essentially at NA’s current lumber production capacity despite these records prices.  [Probably why the lumber companies were reporting bullish new like this only two weeks ago.]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sawmills-selling-boards-faster-cut-142931825.html)  Not exactly a great indicator of an imminent crash in lumber prices *to pre pandemic levels* which is what certain people online want you to think is about to happen.  

**Immediate Future Outlook Also Shows High Demand**

The housing permits increase, despite the surge in lumber prices, shows that builder sentiment is still overall positive and there is even more demand in line waiting for lumber.  The major home builders have passed on the costs to consumers with little problem so far. This is a strong support for the “higher for longer” crowd who have been predicting lumber will stay at historically high margins for longer than 2021 Q2 (which ends in 6 weeks…).

To get some historical context on how much pent-up supply-constrained home construction demand we have: The proportion of authorized housing construction which haven’t begun construction yet is now at the highest level since 1979. [Link](https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1394638539900469252)  That’s a lot of people waiting in line outside the venue, trying to get in.  Would you expect concert ticket prices to drop when there’s a line half-mile long outside the venue…?  

You can also review Chief Economist/Housing Market Expert [Ali Wolf’s twitter feed](https://twitter.com/AliWolfEcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for non-stop anecdotes and stats demonstrating how the new housing market is STILL booming despite these high lumber costs. 

**2020’s Biggest Driver of Lumber Demand Projected to Keep Growing**

According to FEA and other trade groups, the biggest end-use of lumber in 2020 was the renovation sector. [Link to Graphic](https://imgur.com/a/qxsP0i6).  Anecdotally, a lot of people have been saying that they will delay projects because lumber costs too much.  And a bunch of Youtube “economists/investigative journalists” like to go to Home Depot or Lumber yards to show all the wood still there (as if that were valid field research) and cry conspiracy.  And it makes sense that with more people returning to work and the economy reopening that DIY would go down.  

However, the Joint Center for Housing Studies at this place called Harvard University (America’s favorite safety school?) has projected the opposite. [link to study] (https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/press-releases/remodeling-upturn-carry-2022).  While they acknowledge that the smaller DIY projects and renovations are tapering off, the larger professional jobs are picking up.  Demand will stay were it is for the rest of the year and then likely pick up even more in Q1 2022.  It is partly due to jobs that were put off during the pandemic closures, but also from people making more investments in their home because of the current housing market. 

Also, the Home Depot CFO also confirmed that from their side, they are still seeing strong demand on the renovation side from their end and don't expect it to drop any time soon. [Link to earnings call transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/18/home-depot-hd-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)  

Takeaway, I have no doubt that there has been some decrease in demand for lumber from the DIY crowd, but that the drop in demand isn’t as bad as youtube makes it look like and any demand that fell from DIYers is likely being covered by demand from another source: the professional renovations. 

**But isn’t this 2005 all over again thus crash imminent? Not Yet**

There are some things that this housing market has in common with 2005/2006.  But there are also many things that this market does not have in common.  I am not going to get into the differences in the health of the financial markets vs now.  They are different.  A large portions of the home loans are sub-prime mortgage loans.  If you have credible data to the contrary, please share.  

Also, I am not trying to suggest that housing will stay on it’s current manic trajectory.  The housing market is not healthy and at some point it will slow down dramatically or it will correct.  But that’s probably not happening in the next couple months.

From a Supply/Demand standpoint, 2005/2006 are extremely different from today.  Is the housing market manic right now? Yes.  Prices are rocketing up like crazy, similar to ‘05/’06. However, the fundamentals driving this housing market surge is different.   

Inventory of available homes is dramatically different.  In 2005/2006, home prices were shooting through the roof even though the inventory of available homes was also shooting up. [Link to graphic](https://imgur.com/a/bZwtnqd).  On top of that, the US was at an annualized rate of ~2.1 million home starts in 2005.  

So the market was *flooded* with new homes on top of existing available inventory.  For awhile people kept paying more and more for those homes, ignoring the basic economic principle of supply/demand.  However, we have the opposite problem now: there aren’t enough homes to go around.  We are currently at a record low supply of homes compared to demand/population.  So, from that perspective, there is at least a rational basis for the price to soar: scarcity.  Something that wasn’t present then.

The same thing difference exists for lumber supply capacity in NA.  In 2005/2006, NA lumber production/capacity was around ~75 billion board feet.  Current production capacity at end of 2020 was just under 60 billion Board feet. [Link for Graphic](https://imgur.com/a/31E3Aue).  The industry plans to increase its capacity by making some new mills right now, but that will taking another year or more and it’s nothing dramatic that will substantially change the calculus in the next 1-2 years.

So unlike 2005, while the surge in home prices is similar to 2005, the market conditions causing that price surge are fundamentally different, so it is unclear if any credible inferences can be drawn from that time period in assessing our current cycle.

**TLDR:** There are a bunch of morons out there throwing around terms they don’t understand and drawing conclusions that aren’t supported by the larger datasets.  Lumber prices are still rising, even though futures are dropping.  The cash price of lumber WILL correct this summer, but likely not to pre pandemic levels. Make sure you do your homework before making investment decisions regarding housing/lumber.  I am not a financial advisor.    

If anyone identifies flaws in the analysis, please share.  I’d really like to know if I’m missing something here because when I go online and read the commentary, I feel like I am taking crazy pills.

I read about accumulating ETF Fonds, for example this one: [Xtrackers MSCI World UCITS ETF 1C | 24869934 | IE00BJ0KDQ92 (justetf.com)](https://www.justetf.com/ch/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BJ0KDQ92#overview). In theory this sounds great for a long term strategy, since your dividends are directly reinvested, without you having to do that manually again and therefore have new fees to pay. Especially in Switzerland, since we pay taxes on dividends but not on capital gains. But I wonder, since there you don't get more shares with that, since there is no rebuy, isn't that kind of a gamble? 

From what I understand, the idea is that when there is more money in the fonds the value and with that the price of a share goes up. But since the price of one share is not directly linked to the money in the fonds isn't there a real danger that the dividends are reinvested and the price of a share goes down nonetheless and therefore you just losing basically the dividends?

MAY 17, 2021 6:00AM EDT

Investors in software and data analytics group Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock have not had a good 2021 so far. Since the start of the year, PLTR stock is down about 15%. Its current market capitalization stands at $38 billion.

The company, founded in 2013, builds and deploys software platforms to businesses and governments worldwide, as well as U.S. federal agencies so that they can collect and analyze data to make better decisions. It has three main products: Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo. It operates a narrow-moat, as Morningstar analyst Mark Cash pointed out in his latest piece.

Following the direct public offering (DPO) in September 2020, PLTR shares more than quadrupled and hit $45 by late January. But then profit-taking kicked in. On May 11, following the release of first-quarter results, the stock went below $17. Now, it is hovering around $20.

What’s next for PLTR stock? If you are a long-term investor looking to add a high-growth name to your portfolio, you could consider buying the dips. Here’s why.

According to research from SAS, “Big data analytics helps organizations harness their data and use it to identify new opportunities. That, in turn, leads to smarter business moves, more efficient operations, higher profits and happier customers.”

Investors expect software and data platforms like Palantir to capitalize on the growth of big data analytics. Its initial customers were mostly governments, starting with various U.S. federal agencies. However, 2020 also saw commercial contracts with metals miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), and utility PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG). It also partnered with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS unit.

The group’s Q1 results were robust. Total revenue jumped to $341 million, up 49% year-over-year (YoY). Its U.S. commercial revenue grew 72% YoY, and the U.S. government revenue grew 83% YoY.

The net loss was $123.5 million. Adjusted diluted EPS was 4 cents. A year ago, it had been a loss per share of 1 cent. Adjusted free cash flow was $151 million, increasing $441 million YoY.

CFO Dave Glazer told participants on the earnings call that, “With over $2.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet and strong free cash flow in Q1, we paid down our outstanding debt in early April… For our Q2 revenue guidance, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of 43% or $360 million.”

For the 12 months that ended March 31, 2021, the company saw a 29% YoY growth in revenue per customer. The Street was pleased to hear that management believes it can grow 30% per year, in the coming next several years.

Glazer also commented on the possibility of Palantir’s adding cryptocurrencies to its balance sheet. In fact, the group already accepts Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) from its customers. 

For a company co-founded by Peter Thiel, the decision to become involved in financial technology (fintech) was to be expected. He was one of the names who set up PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

Ona final note, we should note that despite the recent decline in price, PLTR stock is not cheap by traditional valuation measures. It trades for about 130x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and 16x current price-to-sales (P/S). Therefore, the shares are likely to continue to be volatile in the short-term.

The Bottom Line on PLTR Stock

Big data is becoming increasingly more important for governments and commercial enterprises. Palantir’s recent results showed management has substantial long-term visibility. Although I’d not want to bottom-pick tech shares amid the continuing volatility, I find PLTR stock to be appropriate for long-term growth portfolios.

Finally, for investors who are interested in PLTR stock but are not ready to commit full capital into the shares, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds Palantir shares could also be appropriate.

Examples include: the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), the First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSEARCA:FPX) and the FlexShares Morningstar US Market Factors Tilt Index Fund (BATS:TILT).

MAY 17, 2021 6:00AM EDT

Investors in software and data analytics group Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock have not had a good 2021 so far. Since the start of the year, PLTR stock is down about 15%. Its current market capitalization stands at $38 billion.

The company, founded in 2013, builds and deploys software platforms to businesses and governments worldwide, as well as U.S. federal agencies so that they can collect and analyze data to make better decisions. It has three main products: Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo. It operates a narrow-moat, as Morningstar analyst Mark Cash pointed out in his latest piece.

Following the direct public offering (DPO) in September 2020, PLTR shares more than quadrupled and hit $45 by late January. But then profit-taking kicked in. On May 11, following the release of first-quarter results, the stock went below $17. Now, it is hovering around $20.

What’s next for PLTR stock? If you are a long-term investor looking to add a high-growth name to your portfolio, you could consider buying the dips. Here’s why.

According to research from SAS, “Big data analytics helps organizations harness their data and use it to identify new opportunities. That, in turn, leads to smarter business moves, more efficient operations, higher profits and happier customers.”

Investors expect software and data platforms like Palantir to capitalize on the growth of big data analytics. Its initial customers were mostly governments, starting with various U.S. federal agencies. However, 2020 also saw commercial contracts with metals miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), and utility PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG). It also partnered with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS unit.

The group’s Q1 results were robust. Total revenue jumped to $341 million, up 49% year-over-year (YoY). Its U.S. commercial revenue grew 72% YoY, and the U.S. government revenue grew 83% YoY.

The net loss was $123.5 million. Adjusted diluted EPS was 4 cents. A year ago, it had been a loss per share of 1 cent. Adjusted free cash flow was $151 million, increasing $441 million YoY.

CFO Dave Glazer told participants on the earnings call that, “With over $2.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet and strong free cash flow in Q1, we paid down our outstanding debt in early April… For our Q2 revenue guidance, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of 43% or $360 million.”

For the 12 months that ended March 31, 2021, the company saw a 29% YoY growth in revenue per customer. The Street was pleased to hear that management believes it can grow 30% per year, in the coming next several years.

Glazer also commented on the possibility of Palantir’s adding cryptocurrencies to its balance sheet. In fact, the group already accepts Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) from its customers. 

For a company co-founded by Peter Thiel, the decision to become involved in financial technology (fintech) was to be expected. He was one of the names who set up PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

Ona final note, we should note that despite the recent decline in price, PLTR stock is not cheap by traditional valuation measures. It trades for about 130x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and 16x current price-to-sales (P/S). Therefore, the shares are likely to continue to be volatile in the short-term.

The Bottom Line on PLTR Stock

Big data is becoming increasingly more important for governments and commercial enterprises. Palantir’s recent results showed management has substantial long-term visibility. Although I’d not want to bottom-pick tech shares amid the continuing volatility, I find PLTR stock to be appropriate for long-term growth portfolios.

Finally, for investors who are interested in PLTR stock but are not ready to commit full capital into the shares, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds Palantir shares could also be appropriate.

Examples include: the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), the First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSEARCA:FPX) and the FlexShares Morningstar US Market Factors Tilt Index Fund (BATS:TILT).

I’m slightly in the positive so I would be okay doing a limit order at break even or a small loss.

Yet, no one can give a definitive answer as to what a “synthetics share” actually is and if they do in-fact need to be purchased back if they were shorted.

So far, there are only three buys I regret:

3) INTC - This has turned out to be a surprise disappointment at this time. In my pre-entry research, Intel had a reputation for being a safe, reliable company that would continue to steadily climb. Unfortunately, after about two days of small gains, Intel has done nothing but tumble. Still, I’m optimistic for its long term because it’s Intel, so I’m holding it.

2) MRNA - Chalk this one up to bad luck. I bought Moderna to chase its earnings report, but the timing couldn’t have been worse: I got in literally MINUTES before the Biden administration announced that the US wouldn’t protect COVID vaccine patents. In a snap, MRNA tumbled 20 points, and to add insult to injury, its earnings report disappointed. Thankfully, it’s only 5 shares, but I’m stuck holding them until MRNA can climb back to 178 again.

1) TSLA - Chalk this one up to being a total n00b. I bought TSLA on my 5th day in the market. I only had enough for one share, but I had to have it. Tesla had been surging for two straight days, and it looked poised to surge again for a third. I was thinking “easy $15 at least.” It turns out I wound up buying it at its peak. Since then, my one share of TSLA has tumbled $200, and with its unpredictability, who knows what direction it’s headed in?

I keep hearing how the current market is likely to be overvalued and all signs are pointing to a bubble.

Apparently Warren Buffet and others have all suggested we will soon see a bear market, but it's impossible to know whether that will be next week or 2030.

With that in mind, my current strategy is value investing for a 1 to 2 year window. I'm looking for massively undervalued stocks (currently my main pick is VIAC) and putting my money there, with the idea that they will outperform the indexes when the dip happens in future.

After the dip, I'd love to go long-term and buy the SNP, chuck in some AAPL and MSFT and some electric car ETFs, but I'm worried if I do that now the arse will fall out of this thing and I'll be left buying at the top of a collapsed market.

## What is Oatly?

Oatly is a Swedish vegan milk maker, producing a sustainable alternative to dairy products using oats. It was formed in the 1990s following research from Lund University, which led Oatly to patent its enzyme technology that turns oats into a milk substitute.

## When is the Oatly IPO?

Oatly’s [IPO](https://www.forex.com/en/market-analysis/latest-research/what-is-an-ipo/) is expected to take place on Thursday 20 May 2021, listing its shares under 'OTLY' on Nasdaq. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Credit Suisse are the underwriters.

The company Oatly announced on Tuesday 23 February that it had submitted a confidential filing for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering is expected to take place following the SEC’s review, depending on market conditions.

Oatly’s IPO would raise money to fund growth, as well as a chance for existing investors to cash in on their holdings.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 18, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**

Stocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It’s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. 

Last week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Now that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available. 
* Square (SQ), one of the leading fintech companies, launched services in Ireland, it’s first foray into the Eurozone as the company looks to expand beyond the US.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

“The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."" -Nelson Mandela",1621369750,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 18, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**

Stocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It’s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. 

Last week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Now that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available. 
* Square (SQ), one of the leading fintech companies, launched services in Ireland, it’s first foray into the Eurozone as the company looks to expand beyond the US.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

The DealBook newsletter explains how ATT got here, in three key deals:

1..A $39 billion bid to buy T-Mobile. After regulatory pushback, in 2011 ATT walked away from an effort to become the country’s largest wireless company. T-Mobile paired up instead with Sprint, and the two went on to buy huge amounts of spectrum in the high-stakes battle for 5G, leaving ATT behind as it lobbies regulators to step in. The failed deal hit ATT with a $3 billion dollar breakup fee, at the time the largest ever.

2.  The $67 billion acquisition of DirectTV. In 2015, ATT bet on cable TV as a way to amass customers whom it could eventually convert to streaming. But DirectTV bled subscribers as customers cut the cord, and ATT unloaded a stake in the company last year to TPG that valued DirectTV at about a third of its acquisition price. The deal also cost ATT about $50 million in advisory fees, according to Refinitiv.

3.  The $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. In 2018, Mr. Stephenson called the deal a “perfect match,” but the combined group struggled to invest in its telecom business while also spending enough to compete with the entertainment specialists at Netflix and Disney. Three years later, ATT is now spinning off the company so it can (re)focus on its quest for 5G market share. ATT paid $94 million in advisory fees to put the two companies together and an estimated $61 million to split them apart.",1621369387,"Details behind AT&amp;T’s debt (cross posted)The article in NYT outlines why ATT has all this horrible debt.

stocks,Things I wish people had told me when I started investing,"This is original content copied from my other post as this community doesn’t allow cross posts but is an equally good home for it.

I’ve been doing really well and I feel like sharing my thoughts for anyone interested. These are the things I wish I had known which would have saved me a lot of setbacks.

Ignore the charts. Don’t even look at them when making a decision. Regardless of what anyone says. A chart will only tell you what has happened so far. It will never tell you what will happen next. There is one exception to this I have found but I will bring that up at the very end of this post.

Use critical thinking for any single piece of information you read about a company or the market. Who published it and why? I haven’t yet found (and probably never will find) a single news article or post with neutral information on a company. And it’s never going to happen. In the stock market there are many different players and they all have different motives. Don’t trust what a Reddit investor tells you. But also don’t trust what CNN or CNBC tell you. There is something called “bias” and you have to be able to adjust the weight you give to any information you receive based on how biased the information is or might be. Any time you get information check multiple sources. Never rely on one single source. Or even one single type of source. If you only trust major news outlets you will be mislead or worse be behind the curve. If you only trust what investing forums say you are likely to run into people who are bagholding and trying to pump the stock to be able to dump it for a higher price before it keeps tanking. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Do your own research and don’t hesitate to use Google’s “past 24 hour” search filter to make sure you’re getting the latest information.

Stay open to criticism. If you have a good idea but someone knows better, it’s not just a learning experience but it can save you from losing your money. However, only take criticism seriously if someone can properly articulate their point and isn’t just spouting catchphrases or being an asshole.

Dollar cost averaging. It’s better to make several buys into a stock than one giant buy. It’s impossible to perfectly time the market. But you will almost always get a better entry point by averaging than by throwing down all the chips on the first move.

Always do your own due diligence. If you can’t write a thesis explaining why you’re making an investment (that’s not only convincing but free of confirmation bias) then you probably shouldn’t invest. Don’t just research the company, research the market the company is in. If the company is poised to do well and corner the market but there isn’t much of a market in general then there is no future for the company. In addition, research the “target audience” not for the company but for the shares themselves. What type of investors are buying shares? Are they the opportunistic kind? Are they buying just for a quick profit to scalp before they dump the stock into oblivion, or are they buying because they see a future for the company and plan a long term hold? This can be true of institutional investors as well as retail. It’s a better sign (for now anyway) when a happy whale like Cathie buys shares banking on the future of a company than if a super-predator like Chamath is buying them for a quick flip. Always keep other investors in mind when you make a decision. Investors are the consumer that drives the price of a share.

Buy the dip but only if you have a good reason to! Don’t blindly buy every dip. I see that pushed too often on Reddit. Buying a dip is good if a company is on an upwards trend and the dip occurred randomly. Do NOT buy the dip if it’s part of a larger downtrend or if it’s possibly due to an overall change in sentiment. Worst case scenario you will multiply your loss and best case scenario you will tie up further capital on a loser which results in decreased ammunition if you suddenly find a winner. Your $500 you could have used to buy a gainer will now be $300 you can use to buy another stock.

Don’t ever hesitate to cut your losses. If a company is in a downwards trend and it looks like they will be for a while (and there is no catalyst around the corner) cut the loss. Put your money in a better place. But keep watching the ticker. You can always buy back in when the sentiment turns positive. Keep a watchlist of stocks that look promising but don’t make it so big that you lose oversight and don’t make it so small that you’re missing too many opportunities.

Gauge your performance by your method and not by your gains and losses. If you’re up 100%, be honest with yourself. Are you up because you got lucky or because you have a solid strategy? If you’re down 40%, was it because of unpredictable factors or was it your own fault because you bought due to fear of missing out which clouded your thinking? Never beat yourself up. Learn from every move you make. Remember it’s impossible to perfectly time anything. If you sold and secured a 10% gain but it could have been 15%, that’s normal. You’re never going to catch the top of a spike or the bottom of a dip. That’s like waiting in the ocean for the perfect wave. It won’t happen and you’ll drown unless you’ve learned to surf when the wave gets to you. Same with buying. Most of the time when you buy, the stock will move down. I’ve lost a small percentage at the start of almost all my well planned and well timed moves. I kept holding and the losses turned into significant gains.

Manage risk and reward. The higher the risk, the lower percentage of your profile you should put into it. Be psychologically prepared to lose everything. The more you’re willing to live with that possibility, the more you’re going to be able to keep a cool mind when taking a calculated risk.

Never stop learning. The more you know, the more of an edge you have. Get in the habit of reading several articles per day. Focus on your existing investments so you can learn how what type of news affects the markets in which ways.

Never stop looking for opportunities. They don’t come to you. You have to find them like a needle in a haystack or a diamond in the rough. You’ll get much better at finding them with time. If you don’t get good at looking for opportunities and evaluating them then you won’t have any opportunities.

Never buy in to hype. The more hyped a stock is, the more likely it is that it will tank later. Even if you find a promising company for a good long term investment, wait until the hype dies down and the share price goes down. Otherwise you’ll start your investment with a slow and steady loss.

Shares are priced based on supply and demand. There are bids and there are asks. The higher the demand is on shares the higher the bids will be. The lower the demand is on a share the lower the bids will be. What this means is that when there is more buying pressure than selling pressure the cost of a share goes up. When there is more selling pressure than buying pressure the cost of a share goes down. In fact, that is all a chart will really tell you. Think of a chart as a historical look at past buying and selling pressure. Nothing more and nothing less. The price direction is determined only by buying and selling pressure.

The value of a share is subjective. You can run any equation you want to but there is no equation which links any of the variables of a company to the price of a share. There are many different ways to “value” stocks. DDM, DCF, price to earnings, price to book, enterprise value to EBIDTA, Technicals...and they all mean nothing. Why? Because the value of a share is what people are willing to pay for it. A stock is no different than a consumer good. Take, for example, iPhone. If you compare the iPhone 12 to android phones with similar specs the iPhone 12 price tag more than doubles some lesser known brands with the same specs. But people are willing to pay more for the iPhone. So the iPhone costs more. The value of a share is the same. If people are willing to pay more for a share of a company then those shares will cost more even if there is no mathematically verifiable reason.

There is no formula based on the specs of a phone which will predict what the retail cost of the device will be. Just like there is no formula which will take any company metrics into account and determine the price of a share.

Stocks go up and stocks go down. Everyone hates red days. But they’re normal and they’re not a sign you’re doing something wrong. They mostly move when there are catalysts that have either positive or negative effects on sentiment. The rest of the time they will trade sideways or slightly downwards. As long as the slope isn’t steep and there have been no bad news about the company having a red day is fine. In fact if a stock was only green all the time I would probably sell it because that could be a good sign it’s in a bubble and bubbles are known for bursting.

The biggest gains and losses in the market are driven by the biggest changes in investor sentiment. And investor sentiment isn’t rational. It’s irrational. For example there could be some slight bad news about a company which will have no bearing on the bottom line (for example a brief delay in a crucial step) which hits a nerve and causes an emotional overreaction which causes the stock to tank. Or there could be some neutral news about a company which investors mistakenly perceive as positive causing the stock to skyrocket.

Catalysts don’t matter. People’s reactions to the catalysts matter. If you look into a company that has upcoming catalysts, don’t focus on how the catalysts will effect the bottom line for the company. Focus on how the catalysts will impact investor sentiment. For example, if a company decides to increase the cost of a pharmaceutical product and they are now going to make 12 billion more dollars over the next 5 years, that’s great for the company. But if people are upset and there is bad publicity like “My mother died because she couldn’t afford her diabetes medication after the price hike.” then the value of a share will go down.

The biggest gains are in speculative investing but they also carry the highest risk. The reason that speculation has the biggest potential for gains is strictly due to human psychology. Investors are going to be a lot more fearful to invest in a company which isn’t generating revenue or where the future of a company has no proven results to back it up. Even if that company is going to cure cancer. But that’s also why there is the potential for a huge reward. If you can find a company investors are fearful to invest in now and you have enough data about the company to conclude that they are going to be successful, then you can actually turn a speculation into a somewhat more secure investment. 

For example, if a company announces that they found a cure for alzheimer’s. And you just happen to be a neuroscientist. If you understand the science and you instantly realize that they have a disruptive breakthrough, you can now use that to your advantage. You can invest in the company now with the knowledge that the science is solid. This gives you an edge. You know that you know the company will be a success. But you also know that anyone who isn’t a neuroscientist will have little faith in the company. As a result, you have now found a company which is setup for a massive change in sentiment. So you buy 10,000 shares for $0.03. Eventually, the company moves through to phase 3 clinical trials and the product gets approved. The news headlines hit that a company cured alzheimers. Now the shares you bought for $0.03 are suddenly worth $15. Your degree in neuroscience just paid off better than your actual day job as a neuroscientist. As the stock keeps trending upwards the $300 you spent is now $150,000. This gain is mostly attributable to using your existing knowledge to get ahead of a pivot in investor sentiment.

Use what you know. Just like the example above. Everyone has areas they are more or less knowledgeable about. If you know a lot about technology, focus on technology stocks. If you are a geologist, focus on mining stocks. Anyone can have an advantage. Even if you’re working at a deadbeat job and you get a free sample for an air freshener that finally actually gets rid of the smell of stale cigarettes in your well used car, invest in that air freshener. Any single piece of knowledge you have about any single thing can be used to your advantage to make a trade.

Which company evaluations actually do matter? Is the company going to be able to survive? That’s the main thing I’ve been looking at with my speculations. A company could have come out with a technological breakthrough. But do they have the funding or an existing revenue stream to carry it out? Are they going to be consumed by debt and implode or are they getting funding in one way or another? Another important one is if another company will buy them out. If a company has mediocre performance and is going to be bought out by Microsoft that can be great for your investment. But if a company has a breakthrough, doesn’t have the resources to commercialize it themselves and has to give in to the highest bidder for a buyout then the upside to your investment is going to be a lot more limited.

Those are really the only company metrics I’m focused on.

Stay up to date on your investments. Don’t just look at your portfolio once a month and complain about it going up or down. Is your chart going up? Find out why. Is your chart going down? Find out why.

Stay ahead of the news! If it’s 5am and you have to get up for work, get in the habit of quickly checking the news on your tickers so that you can stay on top of any changes. The sooner you know bad news came out the more likely it is you will be able to hit the sell button before anyone else does. If you have tickers you’re watching, try to buy in the moment there is good news or in advance of the good news. Especially if the sentiment is positive.

Be careful with stop losses. If you don’t know what a stop loss is, it basically means that you have set up your purchase so that your broker will sell your shares for you if they dip below a certain amount. They can be great for risk management but they can also screw you over. If you bought a company for $10 and you have a stop loss at $8 you won’t be happy when it dips to $7.50 before shooting up to $20. Because now your stop loss actually worked against you. You lost a +100% gain and you secured a loss. Another time stop losses can be unhelpful is if your stock is trading on a foreign exchange as well. For example, if you have a stock on the NASDAQ trading for $10 and a stop loss for $9 but it also trades on a European exchange. It the stock closes at $10 but tanks overnight and trading opens at $5 on the NASDAQ, your stop loss will have done nothing. Even worse, it’s possible your stop loss won’t be triggered at all now because the system won’t pull the trigger while the price of the shares continues to drop.

Market buys, market sells, limit buys and limit sells. I see a lot of confusion about this online and quite a few people get limit orders mixed up with the bid-ask spread. Small fish investors like retail have nothing to do with the bid-ask spread. When you place a market buy order through your broker you are agreeing to purchase a set number of shares at the current market price. I never use market orders. Why? Because if you execute a market buy or a market sell and the price of the security changes rapidly it won’t fill at all. And in order to cancel it and place a new order you first have to find it, then cancel it and then place a new order. I always use limit orders. If I’m buying shares and the cost looks like it’s on an upwards trend I will always place a limit buy for a price quite a bit higher than the current market value. Some people seem to think you won’t get the best price possible that way but this is wrong. If a stock is trading for $8 and you put in a limit buy for $8.50 but the stock only goes up to $8.10 your broker will fill it at $8.10. If I’m buying shares and the cost of the security looks like it’s currently on a downwards trend I will place a limit buy just a bit above what I think it will drop down to. That way I don’t have to stare at the chart all day and I can check throughout the day and place a new order if the direction changed and it didn’t fall below that point yet. As far as selling goes I will always place limit orders as well to guarantee the trade goes through instead of putting faith in a lack of volatility and risking the sell not going through. If the stock is going down I will place a limit sell for a lower price. If the stock is going up I will place a limit sell for a higher price. I won’t make them too much higher or too much lower though because this is the opposite of buying and I don’t want the stock to get stuck to my hands when I’m trying to dump it.

Since investor sentiment drives the price of shares, wouldn’t it be nice if there was a single quick way to gauge the current investor sentiment towards a company? As it turns out, you can! And you can do it really quickly by eyeballing a chart even if you don’t have a clue what you’re doing. Here’s how. Take a look at the chart. Focus on points in the chart where there have been sudden upwards and sudden downwards movements. And look at what happens following those movements.

If the stock dropped 12% due to some bad news, what happens next? Does it stay down or does it climb back up? The quicker it climbs back up out of a dip, the more positive investor sentiment is.

If the stock jumped up 12% due to some good news, what happens next? Does it stay up and slowly keep rising or does it tank back down to levels even lower than before the spike? The quicker it drops back down after a spike, the more negative investor sentiment is.

Keep in mind though that investor sentiment can change and just because there has been overall positive or negative sentiment in the past does not mean that the sentiment will continue. Check news for any updates on the company. Make sure nothing is in the works that could cause the sentiment to change to the negative when you are buying in. Check stock message boards. Check financial news. Use your brokers news feed, they are often quicker to the punch.

It’s definitely more profitable to buy something that has overall positive sentiment.

Edit: I will add, don’t ever be afraid to re-evaluate your strategy. If it isn’t working there’s a good chance it will keep not working. It’s better to try something new than to watch your portfolio slowly erode while you have plenty of time to research and make new moves.",1621364299,"Things I wish people had told me when I started investingThis is original content copied from my other post as this community doesn’t allow cross posts but is an equally good home for it.

I’ve been doing really well and I feel like sharing my thoughts for anyone interested. These are the things I wish I had known which would have saved me a lot of setbacks.

Ignore the charts. Don’t even look at them when making a decision. Regardless of what anyone says. A chart will only tell you what has happened so far. It will never tell you what will happen next. There is one exception to this I have found but I will bring that up at the very end of this post.

Use critical thinking for any single piece of information you read about a company or the market. Who published it and why? I haven’t yet found (and probably never will find) a single news article or post with neutral information on a company. And it’s never going to happen. In the stock market there are many different players and they all have different motives. Don’t trust what a Reddit investor tells you. But also don’t trust what CNN or CNBC tell you. There is something called “bias” and you have to be able to adjust the weight you give to any information you receive based on how biased the information is or might be. Any time you get information check multiple sources. Never rely on one single source. Or even one single type of source. If you only trust major news outlets you will be mislead or worse be behind the curve. If you only trust what investing forums say you are likely to run into people who are bagholding and trying to pump the stock to be able to dump it for a higher price before it keeps tanking. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Do your own research and don’t hesitate to use Google’s “past 24 hour” search filter to make sure you’re getting the latest information.

Stay open to criticism. If you have a good idea but someone knows better, it’s not just a learning experience but it can save you from losing your money. However, only take criticism seriously if someone can properly articulate their point and isn’t just spouting catchphrases or being an asshole.

Dollar cost averaging. It’s better to make several buys into a stock than one giant buy. It’s impossible to perfectly time the market. But you will almost always get a better entry point by averaging than by throwing down all the chips on the first move.

Always do your own due diligence. If you can’t write a thesis explaining why you’re making an investment (that’s not only convincing but free of confirmation bias) then you probably shouldn’t invest. Don’t just research the company, research the market the company is in. If the company is poised to do well and corner the market but there isn’t much of a market in general then there is no future for the company. In addition, research the “target audience” not for the company but for the shares themselves. What type of investors are buying shares? Are they the opportunistic kind? Are they buying just for a quick profit to scalp before they dump the stock into oblivion, or are they buying because they see a future for the company and plan a long term hold? This can be true of institutional investors as well as retail. It’s a better sign (for now anyway) when a happy whale like Cathie buys shares banking on the future of a company than if a super-predator like Chamath is buying them for a quick flip. Always keep other investors in mind when you make a decision. Investors are the consumer that drives the price of a share.

Buy the dip but only if you have a good reason to! Don’t blindly buy every dip. I see that pushed too often on Reddit. Buying a dip is good if a company is on an upwards trend and the dip occurred randomly. Do NOT buy the dip if it’s part of a larger downtrend or if it’s possibly due to an overall change in sentiment. Worst case scenario you will multiply your loss and best case scenario you will tie up further capital on a loser which results in decreased ammunition if you suddenly find a winner. Your $500 you could have used to buy a gainer will now be $300 you can use to buy another stock.

Don’t ever hesitate to cut your losses. If a company is in a downwards trend and it looks like they will be for a while (and there is no catalyst around the corner) cut the loss. Put your money in a better place. But keep watching the ticker. You can always buy back in when the sentiment turns positive. Keep a watchlist of stocks that look promising but don’t make it so big that you lose oversight and don’t make it so small that you’re missing too many opportunities.

Gauge your performance by your method and not by your gains and losses. If you’re up 100%, be honest with yourself. Are you up because you got lucky or because you have a solid strategy? If you’re down 40%, was it because of unpredictable factors or was it your own fault because you bought due to fear of missing out which clouded your thinking? Never beat yourself up. Learn from every move you make. Remember it’s impossible to perfectly time anything. If you sold and secured a 10% gain but it could have been 15%, that’s normal. You’re never going to catch the top of a spike or the bottom of a dip. That’s like waiting in the ocean for the perfect wave. It won’t happen and you’ll drown unless you’ve learned to surf when the wave gets to you. Same with buying. Most of the time when you buy, the stock will move down. I’ve lost a small percentage at the start of almost all my well planned and well timed moves. I kept holding and the losses turned into significant gains.

Manage risk and reward. The higher the risk, the lower percentage of your profile you should put into it. Be psychologically prepared to lose everything. The more you’re willing to live with that possibility, the more you’re going to be able to keep a cool mind when taking a calculated risk.

Never stop learning. The more you know, the more of an edge you have. Get in the habit of reading several articles per day. Focus on your existing investments so you can learn how what type of news affects the markets in which ways.

Never stop looking for opportunities. They don’t come to you. You have to find them like a needle in a haystack or a diamond in the rough. You’ll get much better at finding them with time. If you don’t get good at looking for opportunities and evaluating them then you won’t have any opportunities.

Never buy in to hype. The more hyped a stock is, the more likely it is that it will tank later. Even if you find a promising company for a good long term investment, wait until the hype dies down and the share price goes down. Otherwise you’ll start your investment with a slow and steady loss.

Shares are priced based on supply and demand. There are bids and there are asks. The higher the demand is on shares the higher the bids will be. The lower the demand is on a share the lower the bids will be. What this means is that when there is more buying pressure than selling pressure the cost of a share goes up. When there is more selling pressure than buying pressure the cost of a share goes down. In fact, that is all a chart will really tell you. Think of a chart as a historical look at past buying and selling pressure. Nothing more and nothing less. The price direction is determined only by buying and selling pressure.

The value of a share is subjective. You can run any equation you want to but there is no equation which links any of the variables of a company to the price of a share. There are many different ways to “value” stocks. DDM, DCF, price to earnings, price to book, enterprise value to EBIDTA, Technicals...and they all mean nothing. Why? Because the value of a share is what people are willing to pay for it. A stock is no different than a consumer good. Take, for example, iPhone. If you compare the iPhone 12 to android phones with similar specs the iPhone 12 price tag more than doubles some lesser known brands with the same specs. But people are willing to pay more for the iPhone. So the iPhone costs more. The value of a share is the same. If people are willing to pay more for a share of a company then those shares will cost more even if there is no mathematically verifiable reason.

There is no formula based on the specs of a phone which will predict what the retail cost of the device will be. Just like there is no formula which will take any company metrics into account and determine the price of a share.

Stocks go up and stocks go down. Everyone hates red days. But they’re normal and they’re not a sign you’re doing something wrong. They mostly move when there are catalysts that have either positive or negative effects on sentiment. The rest of the time they will trade sideways or slightly downwards. As long as the slope isn’t steep and there have been no bad news about the company having a red day is fine. In fact if a stock was only green all the time I would probably sell it because that could be a good sign it’s in a bubble and bubbles are known for bursting.

The biggest gains and losses in the market are driven by the biggest changes in investor sentiment. And investor sentiment isn’t rational. It’s irrational. For example there could be some slight bad news about a company which will have no bearing on the bottom line (for example a brief delay in a crucial step) which hits a nerve and causes an emotional overreaction which causes the stock to tank. Or there could be some neutral news about a company which investors mistakenly perceive as positive causing the stock to skyrocket.

Catalysts don’t matter. People’s reactions to the catalysts matter. If you look into a company that has upcoming catalysts, don’t focus on how the catalysts will effect the bottom line for the company. Focus on how the catalysts will impact investor sentiment. For example, if a company decides to increase the cost of a pharmaceutical product and they are now going to make 12 billion more dollars over the next 5 years, that’s great for the company. But if people are upset and there is bad publicity like “My mother died because she couldn’t afford her diabetes medication after the price hike.” then the value of a share will go down.

The biggest gains are in speculative investing but they also carry the highest risk. The reason that speculation has the biggest potential for gains is strictly due to human psychology. Investors are going to be a lot more fearful to invest in a company which isn’t generating revenue or where the future of a company has no proven results to back it up. Even if that company is going to cure cancer. But that’s also why there is the potential for a huge reward. If you can find a company investors are fearful to invest in now and you have enough data about the company to conclude that they are going to be successful, then you can actually turn a speculation into a somewhat more secure investment. 

For example, if a company announces that they found a cure for alzheimer’s. And you just happen to be a neuroscientist. If you understand the science and you instantly realize that they have a disruptive breakthrough, you can now use that to your advantage. You can invest in the company now with the knowledge that the science is solid. This gives you an edge. You know that you know the company will be a success. But you also know that anyone who isn’t a neuroscientist will have little faith in the company. As a result, you have now found a company which is setup for a massive change in sentiment. So you buy 10,000 shares for $0.03. Eventually, the company moves through to phase 3 clinical trials and the product gets approved. The news headlines hit that a company cured alzheimers. Now the shares you bought for $0.03 are suddenly worth $15. Your degree in neuroscience just paid off better than your actual day job as a neuroscientist. As the stock keeps trending upwards the $300 you spent is now $150,000. This gain is mostly attributable to using your existing knowledge to get ahead of a pivot in investor sentiment.

Use what you know. Just like the example above. Everyone has areas they are more or less knowledgeable about. If you know a lot about technology, focus on technology stocks. If you are a geologist, focus on mining stocks. Anyone can have an advantage. Even if you’re working at a deadbeat job and you get a free sample for an air freshener that finally actually gets rid of the smell of stale cigarettes in your well used car, invest in that air freshener. Any single piece of knowledge you have about any single thing can be used to your advantage to make a trade.

Which company evaluations actually do matter? Is the company going to be able to survive? That’s the main thing I’ve been looking at with my speculations. A company could have come out with a technological breakthrough. But do they have the funding or an existing revenue stream to carry it out? Are they going to be consumed by debt and implode or are they getting funding in one way or another? Another important one is if another company will buy them out. If a company has mediocre performance and is going to be bought out by Microsoft that can be great for your investment. But if a company has a breakthrough, doesn’t have the resources to commercialize it themselves and has to give in to the highest bidder for a buyout then the upside to your investment is going to be a lot more limited.

Those are really the only company metrics I’m focused on.

Stay up to date on your investments. Don’t just look at your portfolio once a month and complain about it going up or down. Is your chart going up? Find out why. Is your chart going down? Find out why.

Stay ahead of the news! If it’s 5am and you have to get up for work, get in the habit of quickly checking the news on your tickers so that you can stay on top of any changes. The sooner you know bad news came out the more likely it is you will be able to hit the sell button before anyone else does. If you have tickers you’re watching, try to buy in the moment there is good news or in advance of the good news. Especially if the sentiment is positive.

Be careful with stop losses. If you don’t know what a stop loss is, it basically means that you have set up your purchase so that your broker will sell your shares for you if they dip below a certain amount. They can be great for risk management but they can also screw you over. If you bought a company for $10 and you have a stop loss at $8 you won’t be happy when it dips to $7.50 before shooting up to $20. Because now your stop loss actually worked against you. You lost a +100% gain and you secured a loss. Another time stop losses can be unhelpful is if your stock is trading on a foreign exchange as well. For example, if you have a stock on the NASDAQ trading for $10 and a stop loss for $9 but it also trades on a European exchange. It the stock closes at $10 but tanks overnight and trading opens at $5 on the NASDAQ, your stop loss will have done nothing. Even worse, it’s possible your stop loss won’t be triggered at all now because the system won’t pull the trigger while the price of the shares continues to drop.

Market buys, market sells, limit buys and limit sells. I see a lot of confusion about this online and quite a few people get limit orders mixed up with the bid-ask spread. Small fish investors like retail have nothing to do with the bid-ask spread. When you place a market buy order through your broker you are agreeing to purchase a set number of shares at the current market price. I never use market orders. Why?

I'm thinking $9 and if it goes anywhere near as high as it used to be, massive profit.

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office took up new stakes in Palantir, Citigroup, and Coupang during the first quarter of 2021, regulatory filings show.

Druckenmiller scooped up 5,983,992 shares of Palantir worth $139,367,000 at the time of the March 31 filing. It's the opposite move from Third Point's Dan Loeb, who sold all of his Palantir stake in the first quarter of 2021. The big data surveillance company is down nearly 9% year-to-date. 

Like Loeb, Druckenmiller trimmed his stake in Amazon, selling 7,105 shares. His fund now holds 75,648 shares of Amazon for a value of $234,061,000 at the filing time.

Druckenmiller also added a big bet on newly public company Coupang. The Korean e-commerce company was the largest US IPO in the first quarter of 2021, raising $4.6 billion, according to Renaissance Capital. Druckenmiller added 714,285 shares.

The investor also appears to be betting on the financial sector. He took a new stake in Citigroup, purchasing 2,124,909 million shares worth $154,587,000 at the time of filing. He also scooped up 258,420 of JPMorgan Chase, and added positions in Visa and Mastercard.

Druckenmiller liquidated his positions in cyclical stocks like Disney, cruise liner Carnival Crop, and Live Nation Entertainment. However, he appears to be still betting on the rebound of travel out of the pandemic, as seen by his new $69.7 million stake in online travel company Booking Holdings Inc.

In a recent CNBC interview, the investor said that a ""monkey could make money in this market,"" due to the 
Federal Reserve's easy monetary policies that have pumped ample 
liquidity into all financial markets.",1621357476,"Billionaire investor and Hedge Fund Manager Stanley Druckenmiller loads up on $139,367,000 of Palantir shares, sells Carnival Cruise Linehttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stanley-druckenmiller-13f-palantir-stock-duquesne-carnival-coupang-disney-pltr-2021-5-1030442680

stocks,I have a few questions about the idea of Quote Stuffing,"I've embarked on creating a software that automatically detects fraud attempts through analysing a transaction history stored in CSV files. I must first fully understand the idea bheind Quote Stuffing before emplementing the necessary code.

So from my basic understanding. The fraud dude will post a large buying order of stocks of X. This would be done through HFT algorithms to ensure a large order in a small amount of time, which will task the system a lot of processing time to deal with it. When the price goes up as a result, the fraud dude will cancel their buying order and sell whatever X stocks they've got at that price, making profit.

My questions are: 

* In what form is this Large buy order executed? Are we talking about a high number of consecutive micro buys, or a single big order of an insane number of stocks.
* If, it's a successsion of micro orders, what's the appropriate time interval, from the first fake order to the last, for this to be considered a Quote Stuffing attempt. e.i a 1000 orders in 2 seconds? Can the system detect orders from other traders in between the fraudulant orders?
* does the time of cancelling and amount of canceled orders matter?

stocks,Assertio (ASRT) Stock Split + My Call Option - Please Explain??," I posted this in the options subreddit but since this deals with a stock split...

Assertio (ASRT) stock split overnight

I have an open call option - 9/17 C 0.55, breakeven is 1.14

After the split, the share price jumped up to $1.60. By my dumb math, that means I could exercise the option and sell the 100 shares for a $46 profit. And the expiration is so far away, plus with the volatility of the split, I'd imagine some nice extrinsic value, too.

The problem is that the option is only trading for $8...

Why? How? If the option contract has a an intrinsic value of $46 and it has intrinsic value in it's far expiration and volatility, how is this option contract not currently valued at $50+?

EDIT: I just noticed you can't buy/sell options for Assertio right now...is this standard after a stock split?

Is this possibly the only time it makes sense to exercise my call and sell the stock? Or do I hold and the option price will catch up with reality soon?",1621351442,"Assertio (ASRT) Stock Split + My Call Option - Please Explain??

The first thing that stands out is the shareholders’ equity, which was negative in 2019 and barely shifted to the positive side in 2020. This inflates the ROE (about 35% in 2020 according to my calculation) while the ROIC is significantly lower due to the large amount of debt (about 3%).

Now the near-zero book value and the high debt seems to me like a huge red flag. If one looks at the cash AbbVie is generating, their operational cash flow in 2020 was $17.6 billion and free cash flow was $16.8 billion. About $7.7 billion of that FCF goes out as dividends. The long-term debt interest payments for the next years will be, according to the notes on their balance sheet, in the range of $2.8 billion annually (paid from OFC) and the principal payments $8.4 billion in 2021 and a massive $12.4 billion in 2022 (paid from FCF). That means practically no cash will be left after debt principals and dividend payments to invest in growth, or for buybacks for that matter.

Now this looks like a textbook value trap to me. However, it’s one of the few companies Berkshire has been buying this year so they seem confident. In addition, according to their annual report, they still manage to get cheap loans from the market, so lenders are not seeing them as a risky investment either.

So the question is, what am I missing on their balance sheet? Where’s the value that Buffett is seeing? Is this just a dividend play?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,"How is the float 1.16m and the shares short are 925,000 with 2.3 days to cover? Trinseo (TSE)","Trinseo (TSE) looks to be in the beginning of a breakout. They make one word, “plastics,” and rubber and other chemicals and materials. 

The company blew earnings estimates by 39.25% but are coming off a technical breakdown to the 50 day that consolidated into earnings. 

If you look at the EPS revisions from TSE in their earnings call slide presentation from May 6th the estimated Adjusted EPS for 2021 are 9.12-10.14 vs. analysts are outdated and as low as $4, which they already made this year 🧐, and one gave a $10.04. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75 and today at $69.39.

There’s more...TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% is insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. Now here’s what I don’t understand but find very interesting...how can there be 928,500 shares short with 2.3 days to cover and only 1.16m float? Can someone explain this?Aside from this interesting point I like the stock; not stock advice. 

https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=TSE

TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math, the revisions will be HUGE and this stock might be worth $90/share range relative to 10x earnings. This is not stock advice. I would be interested if anyone can explain the short interest to float here. Either way TSE seems like a lagger in the space with strong operating leverage and strong eps.

Charts Looking Amazing,"The timing couldn't be better for **fuboTV** ([NYSE:FUBO](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/fubotv-inc/fubo/)) to finally put on a winning game face. The live TV streaming provider posted blowout financial results after Tuesday's market close. The stock had hit a six-month low earlier in the trading day. 

Coming through with its third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year top-line growth since going public late last year, fuboTV was full of positive surprises. A historic sequential increase in subscribers during a seasonally sleepy quarter. A big boost to its full-year guidance. FuboTV had [a lot to prove](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/fubotv-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-this-week/) heading into this critical financial update, and it delivered. 

## Playing to win 

There's a lot of skeptic silencing in fuboTV's first-quarter performance. Revenue soared 135% to $119.7 million, well ahead of the 98% to 102% that it was [forecasting in early March](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/03/good-luck-betting-against-fubotv-stock/). This is the second time in a row that fuboTV has put up lowball guidance that it beat with ease. It's a trend that bears noting -- and respecting. 

There's still plenty of red ink here, but with operating expenses only up 80% relative to the 135% top-line burst we're seeing net loss and adjusted EBITDA margins improving. FuboTV's average revenue per user is rising, and against that welcome trend the live TV platform is clocking in with a sequential improvement in subscriber acquisition costs. 

We're seeing tailwinds riding tailwinds here. FuboTV now has 590,430 subs on its books, 105% more than it had a year earlier. Revenue is growing even faster on the heels of a 131% surge in subscription revenue and ad revenue more than tripling. Another neat tidbit on its subscriber count is that it's also 43,000 higher than it was in December. This is the first time that it actually posted a sequential increase in accounts during the first three months of the calendar year. 

FuboTV now sees 830,000 to 850,000 subscribers by year-end, up from the 760,000 to 770,000 it was targeting just two months ago. This is old hat for investors as fuboTV jacked up its 2020 subscriber goal in October, November, and January last time out. This should also be a reminder that any likely revision in a couple of months will probably be higher yet again.

With average revenue per user approaching $70 a month between subscriptions and ads, can things get even better? Well, fuboTV is still on track to roll out a free-to-play interactive gaming app that will enhance the live sports it streams through more than three dozen channels. The stakes will be raised in the fourth quarter when Fubo Sportsbook launches in markets where it can clear legal hurdles. Fantasy sports and then actual wagering will make fuboTV even more money than they are right now, but more importantly, they're going to improve engagement. 

FuboTV has been one of the wildest stocks since its [IPO](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/ipo-stocks/) seven months ago. It was a six-bagger at one point, only to shed more than three-quarters of its value by Tuesday's market open. A blowout quarter is the perfect cure to market indifference.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 17, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 17, 2021**

The market fell modestly on Monday, as concerns over rising inflation, marked by a higher than expected print in the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), continued. Technology stocks continued their volatility, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going as low as 1.42% down intraday before recovering and closing 0.59% down. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.26% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed.

Stocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently, which saw the SPY pulling back 4% before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. 

While the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. 

There are several factors, in my opinion, contributing to the rise of inflation. First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

stocks,"Amazon Gains As Morgan Stanley Paints Bullish Scenario With $6,000 Target","'Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares rose in a weak market after Morgan Stanley 's (NYSE:MS) latest bullish target for the stock: $6,000 by 2023.

According to StreetInsider, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated his overweight rating on Amazon with a target of $4,500, while going on to make a case for the $6,000 per share mark.

The online retailer and cloud services provider currently trades at around 1.2 times 2022 earnings on a PEG basis, an approximately 30% discount to its median tech peer group.

Nowak believes that with Amazon’s scaling profitability and given its discount relative to the peer group, the stock would warrant a $4,500 level at even 1.7 times PEG, according to StreetInsider. But this may not be enough.

Factors like a large addressable market across Amazon’s business lines, including retail, advertising, logistics, healthcare, cloud, autonomous driving and the rising user base of its Prime service all combine to ask for an even higher target for the company’s stock price, the analyst believes, as per StreetInsider.

""These factors could justify a higher PEG, and a PEG of ~2-2.5X would imply a ~$5,000-$6,000 share price within the next 12 months (potentially a double from here),"" Nowak wrote.

I know that not everyone has a precise method to do DDs and research about a company or a stock, but maybe someone does.I'm  from Europe, i'm pretty new in this world and i'm trying to be as more informed and smart as i can.

So, there are some things you have to do if you want to become a successful investor / trader, one of the most important is certainly to research and understand the company you're investing in and the financial instrument you're about to use.

When it comes to do some DD about a stock, i understand there are multiple things to look at.What are the most important in your opinion ? What instruments do you use and why ?

Heres what i'm doing for now:

I usually start reading about the company, its core business and the news about it, then i try to understand what is the financial / economic condition of the company and then i do some technical analysis on the chart, focusing on the price and the value i think the stock could have, and also using MA, EMA, MACd, RSI indicators.

I use mostly Yahoo Finance and [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) for the economical and financial part, and mostly WeBull for the charts.

Finally i try to find some smart opinions on Reddit and maybe discuss the stock with someone else.

Any suggestion ?

**What's BCEI?**
BCEI is a pure-play rural DJ Basin operator. ""Pure-play"" as in they focus solely on extracting oil and natural gas from Denver's Denver-Julesburg (""DJ"") Basin. The tl;dr is BCEI possesses a lot of rural Colorado acreage plus very low operating costs plus significant free cash flow. Combined, it equals it's still undervalued compared to peers in spite of the run up the last few months. 

They will also be the first net zero upstream Colorado company, using offsets to become carbon neutral. Aside from being just good stewards of the environment, they are able to do this because of the fundamentally sound structure of their company. Compared to peers they have less wellheads that make more money. Because their wellheads cost less than their peers, they can afford to invest in them rather than running from spot to spot. [Source](https://ibb.co/5krgsGP)

The reason I love BCEI is because consolidation is the name of the game in the DJ, and they have the best chance to be the big fish that eats all the smaller fish. Whatever company is able to gobble up the other fish the fastest is going to make a lot of money, partially because the DJ Basin is already profitable and partially because increased oil prices are going to push margins up.

The reason BCEI is going to win consolidation is because they developed zero debt during the downturn, and they are already swinging their free cashflow and zero debt around in a huge way. 

They are going to combine with a smaller, more debt-heavy, competitor and the combined company, to be named Civitas, will create the largest upstream player in the DJ Basin. It's going to be a 1-for-1 merger. This follows after the outright purchase of Highpoint several months ago. [Picture of acreage](https://ibb.co/yRNSXnR)

The annual dividend of $1.40 recently announced by BCEI will be increased to $1.60 as soon as the deal closes. Notably, of the significant expected free cash flow for the combined company, the dividend, at the new higher level, only represents an annual outlay of just under $100 mm.

What are they going to do with the rest of the cash? In the past they've played it smart buying high quality companies in their market, like HighPoint Resources, and used these synergies to grow YoY. For example last quarter, with quarterly earnings of $0.88 per share, they beat estimates of $0.73-.76 per share. Their forward looking guidance indicates continued success.

The first thing that I noticed is that large spikes don't occur isolated

Another thing that I noticed was that the large spikes were only attributed to changes from medium to high regimes. 

And small spikes are associated with changes from low to high

This could mean a couple of things

* small to high variance create minor spikes in high variance and are more like market blips 
* medium to high variance create big spikes and are more likely to materialize and a bubble may be present
* a high amount of minor spikes may mean a big spike may be coming.

stocks,Help Me Understand CME Futures And Inflation,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why apparently, tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

stocks,MYOV - Back To Back Catalysts,"Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I’m not a financial advisor. 

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company’s end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe  

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)  

By July 1:  Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application  

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant.  Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner  (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

stocks,Which of the companies would you choose for long term?, Which is the better long term? Like 2-5 years? I would say Costco but I have never been in Target store ever. What are your experiences and analyses? Also what do you think about Sony stock? Do you think they will break record sales again with their PS5 and games after the chip shortage passes? I am wondering should I pull the trigger if it goes below 80 bucks.,1621267002,Which of the companies would you choose for long term? Which is the better long term? Like 2-5 years?

stocks,US or Canadian Dividends,"US or Canadian dividends as a Canadian?

Hi there I have a dilemma I need help on. I have some money to invest upwards of 50-100k for dividends stocks from recent riskier investments and I’m just wondering what is the better option in terms of yeild with the tax on American dividends being larger. One company is Canadian EIT.un. Great company, 10-11% yeild right now. Pay monthly dividend which I like hate waiting for quarterly. Have been paying same dividend for 20 years. 

Or we have ORC which pays 14-15%. Also pays monthly. Company seems solid and both have a long MR of 30% so I can margin them both the same to get my levered dividends for more gains. 

Now my question is for the math and tax experts. Since this money can’t go into a TFSA as mine is currently maxed out, what is the better play for yeild after the tax mans comes for his fair share? Love the 15% but not if is going to be a hot 8% after. Depending on my investments later on the year I should be making around 55000$ on paper but could possibly make upwards of 80-90 if all goes well. 

Let me know what you think! Thanks for anything.",1621266849,"US or Canadian DividendsUS or Canadian dividends as a Canadian?

stocks,A reminder to consider any broker besides Robinhood.,"Just thought I'd post a reminder to anyone that might still be in Robinhood to get away.

They've denied my transfer of assets multiple times, they don't respond to requests for help and when they do they have no issue ignoring your complaints and/or lying to you.

Literally had my assets stuck from January 29th to the end of March.  Also has fraudulent activity on my account that they refused to acknowledge.  

One of their representatives told me to sell stock and then they'd approve my transfer.  I did so against my will and they still denied my transfer.  This is illegal investment advice and they simply don't care.
  
They also blocked my ability to request help on my account and they've stopped responding to me.  

I submitted a request for a call, they called me once, lied to me and then left my request ticket open for weeks so I couldn't request another call.

I've filed FINRA, SEC &amp; BBB complaints.  Got my transfer approved end of March after hundreds of help requests and close to a hundred hours of my time.  

They set up customer service to be ONLY email so they can choose what to respond to and you cannot escalate.  They can lie to you and face no repercussions.  They can &amp; will delay your attempts for help any way possible and they don't care about retail users.

You are not their customer, you are the product they sell.  They don't want their product giving them any problems and they expect you to take what they give you and shut up.

stocks,Specialty retail stocks are bumping: PLCE and DDS particularly,"Retail stocks have been on a surge in the past 6 months. The biggest gainers in this space are DDS (Dillards) and PLCE (The Children's Place). Both could be considered boomer stocks that still rely on brick &amp; mortar, especially Dillards. But both company's are carrying strong tailwinds from reopening and pent up demands.

PLCE has Q1 earnings coming up on May 20. PLCE mainly sells children's clothing. And I think analysts and investors are pricing in the next 4 months of growth as COVID is lifting, kids will need new clothing for summer (parties, birthdays, etc) as well as back to school in 4 months. PLCE in Q4 reported that their digital sales are up, but that they're revenues are still down. Macro factors, they're still worried about declining birth rates. Since January, PLCE is up almost 70%, mostly through reliable increasing revenues and earnings. Despite revenue not beating expectations, they're still doing well.

One thing to note with PLCE using their Q4 2020 returns: https://investor.childrensplace.com/static-files/26f7ea63-8d41-481a-984d-b53f68e13032

In February 2, 2019 they made $1.9B in sales with profit of $111M.  At that time, their stock was trading at about $100. They're on track to hit that number in 2021 and even surpass it based on analyst estimates. We could see 50% more upside from PLCE if their Q1 results show anywhere near $600M in sales.

DDS is a different story. DDS just announced a $500M share buyback and a $0.15 dividend. This was on Friday. And since then, DDS has jumped almost 40%. It opened Friday at $107 and its currently trading at $142. On Friday, it was trading as low as $100 at one point.

A $500M share buyback will be done at the market:
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dillards-announces-stock-buyback-worth-%24500m-to-pay-%240.15-quarterly-dividend-2021-05-17

&gt; Under the new buyback program, the company can acquire securities via open market transactions as well as private negotiations.

The dividend is payable on August for investors as of June 30.

The P/S ratios of the department store industry are between 0.28 and 0.50, with DDS being on the high side. But their revenues are increasing and with a share buyback that will lower their total float, thus decreasing their P/S, DDS could be an exciting story. The funny thing is that DDS options have spiked in IV, so I would probably buy shares to avoid any major losses due to stock dump after June 30's ex-dividend date.

If you're looking non-tech plays to diversify your portfolio, but still have some aggressive gains, PLCE and DDS may be nice additions.


Anecdotally, many states are reducing social distancing restrictions. I could see department stores getting lots of benefits from traditional forms of shopping. I don't think the retail-pocalypse has destroyed the entire industry quite yet.",1621264807,"Specialty retail stocks are bumping: PLCE and DDS particularlyRetail stocks have been on a surge in the past 6 months.

stocks,Help a Novice Improve Embryonic Portfolio?,"So I recently started investing the last few months and am getting cold feet from modest losses. I plan to invest roughly $1000 more in the next few months.

I got a few shares of AAPL (I’m a total fanboy) at 135 and quickly learned I should have DCA’d. I started to diversify, adding in small $10-20 portions of GOOG and FB here or there—whenever I saw a dip.

I have 10 shares of FNMA at about $2 (my friend from college was convinced it will moon...)

I dabbled in crypto with about $200 (split between ETH, ADA, MATIC,BTC) but because of my timing the results have so far been *dismal*—so I’m here today!

I’m considering UAL as a reopening play, and want to diversify out of just tech. Maybe into alternative energy/sustainability projects, and perhaps in gene mapping and editing techs but I don’t really know where to start.

Since most of my assets are crashing I want to invest in some safer ETFs. I’m thinking SPDR and NASDAQ, and maybe some tech and green energy ones, and some that will profit from massive gov infrastructure spending. Again I don’t know where to start.  

I’ve seen a lot of mentions that “growth” stocks are bad and “value” stocks are good because of worries about inflation. But I have no idea what the difference is. Is now even a smart time to invest? I feel like I should have done this a year ago... :(

I’m in this for the long haul, but I don’t want to invest in something that might be *deep* red the next few years (hence I’m not putting a dime more into crypto; stocks and etfs seem as safe as savings by comparison and that’s what brought me here)

**Stats**

Market Cap: 10.28B

Dividend: 0.77%

**P/E Ratio: 5.12 (comps are in the 10-25 range)**

Why they are not valued in the $200-$300/share range is beyond me. Currently, they are in the $75 range. They were as low as $15 back in April 2020, meaning at one point, their P/E ratio was even *lower* than what it is now.

This seems like an amazing opportunity to get exposure to the growing lumber market. Any thoughts?

stocks,TWLO: What happens when SMS becomes obsolete?,"Been doing some DD on TWLO and can't wrap my head around what to me seems like one of the key risks/bear scenarios, being the eventual decline/obsolescence of SMS. 

I believe in the bull thesis and think Jeff Lawson has an amazing vision for the business and potential to grow the business into a developer-led customer engagement business, but today, the core business is still being a communications API provider. 

TWLO generates 45% of its revenue currently from SMS, providing the API which is used by businesses to prove an array of services, marketing, notifications, updates and codes to name a few examples. 

Unlike voice or email which does not appear likely to be replaced, when you look at SMS, it's hard to see a world where SMS thrives over the various chat apps, given the limited functionality of SMS over the internet-based apps. The only advantage SMS has over an internet app is it its ubiquity and platform/device agnostic nature, which affords it a high degree of visibility and front-page status on most people's phone real estate. Part of this, I would argue, is also because old habits die hard and we all expect SMS when interacting with those outside of our social networks.

However, if the West goes the way of what is being seen in China, with the almost universal adoption of a singular chat app e.g. WeChat, we could see the use and value of SMS decline, as is being observed in China. 

Without solving for the complexity and obstacles in connecting internet devices to the legacy PSTN network, TWLO's value add is greatly diminished, and whilst they still provide API services for apps such as Whatsapp, FB etc, this relies on the communication being routed through TWLO as part of an omni-channel solution. If Whatsapp reaches out directly to the end customer through their platform, TWLO is not involved in that transaction. 

This also increases the reliance on big tech to allow TWLO to provide these services. 

On one hand, SMS usage in the near term is forecast to grow, and tools such as TWLO's APIs will unlock effective, powerful and hopefully two-engagement that benefits both business and customer. The use cases are just getting started. On the other hand, I can see a world where the pace of SMS obsolescence increases as we become saturated with marketing and often unwanted notifications, and we slowly migrate to different applications/platforms for our real communications, relegating the SMS app to the attic in our phones, only checking it occasionally when we know we are expecting something. This decline in eyeballs would then reduce the effectiveness of SMS for businesses and marketers, diverting these communications to a realm where TWLO has limited ability to monetise. 

I don't know if i'm just missing something or it's just me, I haven't read much debate/discussion on this when reading about TWLO so just curious on people's thoughts.",1621253649,"TWLO: What happens when SMS becomes obsolete?Been doing some DD on TWLO and can't wrap my head around what to me seems like one of the key risks/bear scenarios, being the eventual decline/obsolescence of SMS.

stocks,MATERIALS - Trinseo (TSE) Crushes Earning - STRONG VALUE PLAY,"Trinseo looks to be in the beginning of a breakout. The company blew earnings estimates by 39.25% but there have been very few revisions by the lazy analysts and algorithms. 

The company revisions in their earnings call slide presentation on May 6th project Adjusted EPS of $9.12-10.14 in 2021. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75. 

There is MORE! TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% by insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k, yes that is a K for 375,790 shares traded on average. Meaning to be that once volume by retail catches on the stock could bounce quickly. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math the revisions will be HUGE! 

Lastly, the technicals on the chart finally straightened out to where the 20,50,100 and 200 day moving averages are back in order and hence, “BEGINNING OF A BREAKOUT.”

stocks,"Disco for $DISCA. Why Discovery is the play, and why it’s due for a short squeeze","TL;DR $DISCA is ripe for a push upwards

I am not a financial advisor and I am not good at writing DD’s with fancy colors and graphs. Please do your own research before investing

About 2 months ago we saw the fallout of Archegos, and Bill Hwang become a laughing stock after losing 20 billion dollars from his margin call. Viacom ($VIAC) and Discovery ($DISCA) were among the hardest hit in that selloff. Let’s cut to the chase on why this is this is ready for takeoff, and that big buyers are gonna swoop this back up to new highs 

For starters, the stock currently has a moderately high short interest ratio of 25%. It’s amongst the top shorted stocks within the NYSE. 

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/

On top of the moderately high short interest, you might notice $DISCA is the class A version of the stock. There are actually two other tickers discovery sells shares for: $DISCB and $DISCK. What’s very interesting is despite $DISCK and $DISCA shares trading relatively similar prices, $DISCB shares have actually soared since the selloff, and are trading at double the amount of the regular class A shares. What’s the difference between class A and class B shares? Simple.

“The difference between Class A shares and Class B shares of a company’s stock usually comes down to the number of voting rights assigned to the shareholder.  Class A shareholders generally have more clout”


https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062215/what-difference-between-class-shares-and-other-common-shares-companys-stock.asp

Now, why is this due for a squeeze? Today, news came out about AT&amp;T wanting to combine media assets with discovery, pushing the valuation of the company to a whopping 150 Billion dollars. Currently, Discovery’s market cap sits at a valuation of 17.41 billion dollars, meaning this merger would push its valuation up 8.6x. I dont know about you guys but that sounds pretty wild to me.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/5aeba5f9-2e00-4cba-b9c7-e0431aad798b

stocks,The cleanest re-open play left - Simon Properties," Starting in early fall last year, I kept questioning many of my recovery-related positions as having already had their run. As weeks and months went by, stocks in those industries kept increasing - airlines, cruises, casinos, et al. Come February, I wanted to find more recovery plays and landed on one of my better trades of the last few months - call options on Live Nation ($LYV). In the last few weeks I wanted to do more digging as I questioned that maybe there's something left as a recovery play. I ran across $SPG, Simon Properties Group.

I believe SPG is a great pick as it has big upside potential for a large cap stock (40bn market cap), with minimal downside risk. Being mostly an investor/owner of malls (the largest in the nation), and mall-like real estate, the stock was obviously shot down at the start of the pandemic last year. It has recovered since but not to pre-Covid levels and far from all time highs of $229 (currently at $122).

As weeks and months went by, stocks in those industries kept increasing - airlines, cruises, casinos, et al. Come February, I wanted to find more recovery plays and landed on one of my better trades of the last few months - call options on Live Nation ($LYV). In the last few weeks I wanted to do more digging as I questioned that maybe there's something left as a recovery play. I ran across $SPG, Simon Properties Group.

I believe SPG is a great pick as it has big upside potential for a large cap stock (40bn market cap), with minimal downside risk. Being mostly an investor/owner of malls (the largest in the nation), and mall-like real estate, the stock was obviously shot down at the start of the pandemic last year. It has recovered since but not to pre-Covid levels and far from all time highs of $229 (currently at $122).

stocks,Trying to understand the pros and cons of buying on a margin,"Hi, I’m relatively new to investing. I started buying stocks in February and you have really gotten into it and enjoy it immensely. There are however, a lot of parts of investing that I really don’t understand. I google stuff constantly and try and do my own research but it can get pretty confusing. 
My current question is about margin buying. I was recently offered the ability to use margin buying on RH and was given an $11,000 margin which seems dangerous to me because from what I have gleaned from my research, buying on margin is like using credit from whatever platform you’re using to invest. 
Let’s say I use $500 on the margin to buy stock, when I deposit more money will they automatically take that $500 back? Is that how you pay it off? Are they making money off of this? Like hidden fees and exorbitant interest rates and stuff like that?I guess what I mean is, overall, is it sketchy? Should I avoid buying on a margin? 
One reason I’ve seen given as a benefit is that you’re able to buy more stock at the time when you need to and therefore can make more profit because it gives you additional capital to invest. That makes sense, but again I wonder what their angle is. I really don’t want to get myself in a bad situation because I’m ignorant.

There are literally only two ways to buy in: KRBN, a mix of credits from different countries stabilized by short term treasuries; and GRN which is a pure play in EU market carbon credit.

Is there something other than ""stuff with higher returns is on fire sale"" that has an effect on carbon's performance as a commodity?

Also, my parents want me to invest for them as well. Would ETF’s be a good option for long term growth (such as QQQ or VOO)? Something they can cash out in 15-20 years...

Thank you so much for your help in advance &lt;3",518,23,495

Seem familiar?

Bread is one of the worst things in the world, but we’ve always needed it. Until now!

By burning three diff types of meat together, the Tracy Jordan Meat machine takes bread out of the equation!

Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff! That’s delicious. 

Doctor: “And its healthy. Hi, I’m Dr. Leo Spaceman. I’m a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Min school of medicine.”

Dr. Spaceman, is it true that bread eats away at your brain?”

Doctor: “We have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research!”

Well folks, bread will never maybe attack your brain again. Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine, say it with me now:

&amp;#x200B;

**MEAT IS THE NEW BREAD!**

\[Look up 30 Rock- Tracy Jordan Meat Machine if want to watch this, much better than words can describe\]

&amp;#x200B;

**FEYE**\- FireEye, I have some of this as the company is highly regarded by cyber security professionals. Often where they go when they need help! Saw them in the headlines this week due to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of Colonial, they just paid the ransomware ransom of 5 million dollars to the group DarkSide who now apparently plans to disband and apologized for all the gasoline worries! How kind.

&amp;#x200B;

**BMW** seems to be decent luxury car maker pure play. 46% owned by two brothers so no risk of takeover, rejecting all the bells and whistles of advertising in favor of simply making a good product and selling it. China sales doubled \[while TSLA sales down in China\]. p/e under 20 for the German ticker. Need to look at the ADR to see how many German shares it represents 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rblx**\- loss of 0.46 per share \[0.25 miss\]; revenue was up 147% YoY\[miss\] and bookings were higher. Daily active users also increased 79% YoY up to 42.1 million. Rblx appears up on the earnings and calls outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with May 14th 70 call being most actively traded contract as of Tuesday \[source schwab options report\]- I have a handful of shares as tons and tons of daily users.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of China, seeing **speculation** that China’s Crypto is going to be **gold** backed which should be interesting in terms of gold supply and demand. I have a couple shares of some random gold miner and maybe a gold etf I dont know. But yeah. Very interesting and potentially paradigm shift. I could not confirm that it would be gold backed through any article that appeared completely neutral. They would likely try to divest their holdings of US Debt/US Currency prior to formally announcing this as it would cause shocks across the FOREX markets I would think and devalue USD and possibly others.

 Market week ran an article on how much Gold China owns, very interesting read. I am and have been bullish on China, I own baba, tencent and many other Chinese tech companies. I think absent some world war or full blow Cold War that China will be the next global super power for good or ill so take that as you will. I also am long the yuan for this reason despite not necessarily supporting China in a social/moral sense.\[lets go back to only doing camps for fun instead of for whole portions of populations for no other reason then ethnic/religious backgrounds!\]

&amp;#x200B;

I am still long on the stay at home thesis, yes there is pent up demand to go out and shop/eat/travel, but after this experience I think people may invest more into their home just so they are not caught off guard if this were to happen again in the future. Combine that with the increased work from home workforce and I think the stay at home stocks will be just fine in the long run.  The sell off in tech is an entry point if you don’t believe that the whole system will ultimately collapse and you have the ability to wait out the downturn.  The only way to time the absolute bottom is blind luck so just buy companies you like at valuations that don’t offend you and I believe you will be fine over the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

We are now showing **Fear** on CNN fear and greed index.  A year ago it was more fearful, but some great returns were built in those times, so perhaps the recent pullbacks over inflation concerns are overblown.  If you believe in the continued recovery of the world economy then I think definitely time to start being a little bit greedy.  As Buffett and others have said- be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

&amp;#x200B;

Times like these are where the greatest returns can be born.

&amp;#x200B;

**VMW**\- new CEO techno centric- VMWare. Been with company since 2003 when was still a startup and now 12 billion business. He’s been leading push into selling software that lets companies run their internal and external apps in multiple cloud computing services and in house data centers. NO requirement for employees to return to physical offices full time which seems like Ag old move as some other companies that said would promote people who came back into office over those WFH faced a walkout. The need for options is essential in keeping high value employees without making them feel ostracized for making decisions that are best for themselves and there family. Currently trading in the 156 range yahoo consensus is  170.79; 32 p/e. 4.86 EPS.  Earnings report 5/27/2021, I may try and pick up a couple shares before earnings or see what other options are for long term investment this seems like one to me. I like operators at the head of company over salesman, they can lay the foundation for them to remain relevant and hire other people to toot their horn.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sanctuary, an astrology startup that also sells psychic readings to users for no low price. U.S. laws around psychic readings are patchwork at best, with CEO and founder Ross Clark arguing the app is offering entertainment rather than fortune-telling—exempting it from the more onerous of state laws. The readings, Clark says, is a practice in empathy rather than actually peering into the crystal ball. But still, the question remains, is funding the practice ethical? 

Some investors think otherwise. Lux Capital’s Josh Wolfe on Twitter did not mince his words upon hearing news of the startup’s seed funding: “Seriously shame on anyone funding or encouraging this bullsh\*t. No doubt there is demand, but this isn’t peddling entertainment, it’s encouraging slippery slope snake oil flapdoodle.” Here too is Vinod Khosla at Khosla Ventures in response to Wolfe’s tweet: “Agree. There is also demand for heroin, fat, sugar… I’d be ashamed to fund such a venture.” 

Proponents argue that astrology and psychic readings play a similar role as religion or therapy, while its detractors argue the practice is rooted in pseudoscience. 

 

Disrupters on the dip, possible entry points if like the companies:

&amp;#x200B;

**TSLA**\- recently big dip.  They do have decent advantage in EV market having good tech but there is tons and tons of money being burned by competitors to catch up and overtake. Currently \~36% down from its 52 week highs.

&amp;#x200B;

**ETSY**\- 37% off its 52 week highs. Still vulnerable because growth stock and these will be the first sacrificed in any major downturn. But it is rapidly growing and it is the only one focused solely on creative goods made by artists/entrepreneurs. Gross merchandise sales \[3.1 billion\] 132.3% YOY increase in Q1, net income \[143.8 billion\] up 1048.1% YOY. Yahoo price target consensus at 226.13. Did turn a profit. 3.52 EPS, 46.32 P/E. 20.73 Billion market cap. I own some and have been happy. Seems like they use debt sparingly and have a good cash flow. So probably would sell off in major downturn but doubt would be in danger of bankruptcy or not being able to weather a storm.

&amp;#x200B;

**LOVE**\-Lovesac- American furniture retailer. I’m not sold here but they do modular furniture and apparently doing pretty well. 4 years of double digit net sales growth, expanded digital channels during pandemic, makes products from recycled plastic bottles and furniture built to last lifetime so that is appealing. Yahoo price target consensus for one year at 74.50 which is lower then the \~75 its at now. EPS .96, P/E 79.07. Would think about it if pulled back but not at current price myself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some REITS to consider: 

&amp;#x200B;

**FRT**\- Federal Realty Investment trust, focusing on shopping centers, street retail, mixed use. Major markets in LA, DC&lt; NY, Silicon Valley. Many tenants like grocery stores, restaurants, fitness centers, service based business. 3.8% dividend.  I would be worried about the markets they are in as there is a recent exodus from cities like this in favor of the new tech centers such as Austin and Miami. 

&amp;#x200B;

**IIPR**\- Innovative Industrial Properties- this one has been on my radar for a year +, I got in fairly early and sold last march to reap the profits as thought downturn was going to be longer lasting.  I am back in a couple shares and happy. It specializes in medical cannabis growers. So they just set up the warehouses and have triple net leases IIRC so they have virtually no ongoing costs and just reap rent profits. Cannabis use seems to be up big in the pandemic so may be a lasting trend and with it becoming legal in more and more states I think this is a long term smart play.  3.16% dividend on the normal shares and does sell preferred shares with larger dividend as well. Only have one share in the normal, down 3.76% on stock price I bought at and \~4 shares in the IIPR/PRA 9% preferred dividend I am up \~14%. No plans to sell either.

&amp;#x200B;

**STAG**\- stag industrial, inc. invests in warehouses across country, \~40% of portfolio is leased to e-commerce tenants. Biggest tenant is AMZN, but AMZN constantly looking to cut out middle men and achieve vertical monopolies in every field they operate it seems.  The good thing for STAG is that IIRC, this came up on my radar a while back and many of their properties are located in key areas around international airports and there is only so much warehouse space available that is located in key spots like this, so while AMZN can very well replace them in areas that have space, this may not be possible for reasonable costs in metropolitan areas, especially around airport hubs. I do have a couple shares in here and am up \~20% with no plans of selling at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Will be interesting to see how we do as Mask Mandates are ending across the country as we approach the 4th of July and summer traveling season.  Will enough of America be vaccinated/have natural immunity due to infection to prevent another spike? Will the world get it together before we create and spread a variant that does not respond to vaccines? Time will tell, and possibly present some fire sales if the panic and fear sets in again a la March 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

**CriCut**\- MarketBeat presented this as a very interesting company but my subsequent \[quick research\] did not back that up. Allegedly company that helps people design and build any idea they might have. Growth at triple digit rate. Not profitable. Added 600k new users last quarter. Paid subscriptions up 140% to 1.6 million paid subscriptions. Yahoo price consensus around 27 with 5 analysts weighing in from a low of 23 to a high of 35. Currently \~24-25. Something I will look into...searching online just brings up a bunch of fancy label makers though a nod on website not seeing this design and build any idea so not sure what this article is talking about. If anyone sees something I missed let me know because from article looked very interesting. Not so much after looking at website and reading the wiki.

I decided to have my portfolio set up like this because I wanted to be extremely aggressive, not to mention this dip helped me buy in at prices that are impossible to buy up. 

My question is this; Should I re-arrange my portfolio for a safer option? What are your thoughts and thanks for any help / constructive criticism!",1074,15,1059

stocks,Inflation: timing stocks as an hedge?,"Lots of people are saying stocks are the best hedge against inflation, as companies will absorb costs and raise prices. However, the current S&amp;P yield is around 2%. If central banks raise interest rates to tame inflation, valuation of bonds and stocks will have to ajust to offer a higher yield. So if the 10 year US bond yields reach 3-4%, you can’t justify a 2% yield on S&amp;P considering it’s a riskier asset. So current stocks valuations should fall. But then, when the S&amp;P valuation is adjusted, it would be the perfect timing to buy/hold and hedge against inflation.

Is this thinking correct?",1621172455,"Inflation: timing stocks as an hedge?Lots of people are saying stocks are the best hedge against inflation, as companies will absorb costs and raise prices.

I personally believe stocks will keep going up with a few corrections but no big crash. I think the big one will happen within the next 5-10 years due to a financial crisis. As for the housing frenzy, I believe that will burn out in a couple years and drive prices down ~20%.

stocks,Trying to understand the ARK Fund Backlash,"Cathie Wood has been getting slammed lately as the ARK Funds suffer some steep losses. My question is what is she supposed to do? Growth stocks as a whole have been taking a hit. The ARK Funds are described on their website as “ETFs focused on disruptive innovation”. This alone says ARK is bit of a risk and will focus on companies replacing the status quo. That may take some time. I do believe it will happen though. Take ARKF, for instance, she’s not going to go and invest in a company that prints out paper checks or manufactures atm cards. Square, Shopify, Zillow are a few of the top holdings. Obviously, each has seen incredible growth. They may taking a hit now but may represent the status quo in the future.

Also, other fintech etfs have suffered the same fate recently. Others may not have fallen so far but that seems to be because they weren’t as successful during the big run up late last year

I'm a novice investor and I’m genuinely curious as to what she could have done differently. Is it how certain companies were weighted in the funds?

stocks,Discussing the risks associated with stocks,"One thing that I think isnt talked about enough on this sub is risk.  I see a lot of posts and comments from people upset about their investment/trading choices not working out, and I think a lot of that comes from a lack of acknowledgement of the risks associated with stocks.  It often times seems as though people interpret 'high risk/high reward' as 'most likely high reward with maybe a small short term downside'.

This post isnt meant endorse a bear or a bull case in general - make your own decisions based on your research.  This post is more to encourage people to try to better understand the downside possibilities of different positions.

For starters, an all stock portfolio, even one where you're only invested in passive tracking funds, has historically been considered pretty high risk.  SPY was around $150 in 2000, and touched the $80s in 2002 and 2008.  This represents more than a 40% loss for someone who didnt dca into it during that period.  People starting out this year should acknowledge that sort of thing could possibly happen over the next 8 years, even if you don't think it will.  

Individual stocks, even the safe, mature dividend stocks, can fluctuate greatly depending on market conditions.  Competition pops up, costs increase, demand shifts, technology changes.  Nothing is 100% safe from a large drop given a bad turn of events.  Highly speculative stocks without earnings are even more sensitive and susceptible to large drops as we've seen recently.  Maybe these stocks continue to grow in anticipation of big future earnings, but they've also got the potential to lose most of their value if the market conditions turn against them.

Before I buy a stock, I go through the history and outlook for that company and also for that industry.  I take special note of downturns and acknowledge what I think is a reasonable downside for that particular stock.  Acknowledging and accepting those risks help me stay away from trades that are higher risk than I actually want, and helps me keep my conviction when my choices are struggling.

If you're new to investing and trading, make sure you give enough thought to how far the stock or etf you're researching could fall, and make a reasonable decision on if that fits with your appetite for risk.",1621113470,"Discussing the risks associated with stocksOne thing that I think isnt talked about enough on this sub is risk.

stocks,Inflation now is everywhere,"


The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

The Fed calls this “transitory”, citing lower prices in April 2020 due to lockdowns in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The mainstream media were quick to point this out. Some news added that the rise in prices is because the economic growth is accelerating. The problems with these apologetic excuses for rising prices are many. If these increases are solely based on the low numbers in April 2020, then why have they soared from just one month ago? If the economy is doing so well, why does the Fed continue to print ~$120bln a month and keep the Fed Funds rates at essentially zero? Why is Government falling all over himself to spend money on everything, it seems, to the tune of trillions in additional fiscal stimulus. No, the economy is not booming, because if all of these stimuli were ended tomorrow, everything would collapse. It’s that simple.

The truth is that unemployment remains extremely high, the labor participation rate low, and we’re seeing supply shocks develop across the economy. This means fewer people producing fewer goods and providing fewer services. At the same time, dollars printed out of thin air are being pumped into the system left and right. How does giving the unemployed a check once a month while providing nothing in return not create higher prices? I apologize for the following patronizing example, but just to illustrate the point clearly:

Say you have 10 cartons of milk and $10 circulating in the economy. All else aside, what is the price of each carton of milk? $1.

Now say you increase the amount of money circulating in the economy to $20. What is the price now? $2. An inflation rate of 100%, from $1 to $2.

Now let’s say that the number of cartons of milk falls from 10 to 5. What is the price of a carton of milk now? It’s $4, because now you have $20 chasing 5 cartons. An inflation rate of 400%, from $1 to $4.

The point being that if you create more money out of thin air and at the same time reduce the amount of goods and services to purchase, prices soar. This is the real reason we’re seeing prices rise, and it’s not transitory. 



As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Any shop  or the grocery store. It’s not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don’t hold your breath, imho.

Negating the transitory nonsense, the month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time—i.e., the CPI is likely going even higher. 

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a “return to work bonus” in order to get people to go back to work.

Don’t get me started on housing prices. The point being: Inflation is everywhere.

So, what happened to bond yields when these numbers came out? The 10-Year rose from 1.61% to 1.70%. The 30-Year rose from 2.33% to 2.42%. Now this may not seem like a lot, but the market was not buying the Fed’s rhetoric ahead of the inflation numbers and much of the impact was already priced in. Taking this into account, the 10-Year was 1.47% just four days ago and is now at 1.70%. That’s a huge move for bonds in such a short space of time. The 30-Year was 2.16% last Friday.

the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%, imho.

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. 
So the trend is up !
I am just ape no financial advice !!

January 1999, 60 Minutes interview (https://www.you----.com/watch?v=Yv8MrBBuRqI)

(00:21): “... and where is Amazon’s headquarters? … 1516 Second Avenue… We didn’t see anything that looked vaguely cutting edge… Upstairs, it doesn’t look very high-tech, either. More like a college dorm than a corporate headquarters. And then there’s the boss; you generally hear him before you see him… you can afford a better desk than that… and you don’t need clean carpets.”

(06:08): “Is this investing or this gambling?”

“Right now, with the frenzy we’ve had, to me, it feels much more like gambling.”

“Because it’s crazy?”

“I don’t find it to be rational, to be honest with you.”

“But investors keep flooding in. Why? Amazon snagged almost 2 million new customers at the end of last year. And like other internet companies, it’s growing much faster than those old blue chips.”

Recent interview with Jeff Bezos (https://www.you----.com/watch?v=hwskqpf0E6Y)

“Most of those companies of the dotcom era are out of business. You survived. What was it that made you to survive and virtually the rest of them are gone?”

Jeff: “Well, that whole period is very interesting, because the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock. So, as I watch the stock fall from 113 to 6, I was also watching all of our internal business metrics. Number of customers, profit per unit, umm, you know, everything you could imagine; defects, etc. Every single thing about the business was getting better - and fast.”

The biggest change comes with WISH’s increase in logistics revenue (revenue from facilitating delivery of product). Info found in most recent quarterly report, link as above:

Three months ended March 31 (in millions USD: 2020 / 2021):

Logistics revenue: $56 / $245 (increased 337%)

Revenue: $440 / $772 (increased 75.5%)

Overview of Wish Local, which is part of its increase in logistics revenue: https://www.you----.com/watch?v=WBkP2FtSq00

Wish Local might seem like Amazon’s ability to deliver to post offices and other pickup locations, but a key difference is that Wish Local allows the pickup locations (retailers) themselves to sell their wares via the Wish App and to carry popular items from Wish, earning a commission on in-person sales.

January 1999, 60 Minutes interview (https://www.you----.com/watch?v=Yv8MrBBuRqI)

(00:21): “... and where is Amazon’s headquarters? … 1516 Second Avenue… We didn’t see anything that looked vaguely cutting edge… Upstairs, it doesn’t look very high-tech, either. More like a college dorm than a corporate headquarters. And then there’s the boss; you generally hear him before you see him… you can afford a better desk than that… and you don’t need clean carpets.”

(06:08): “Is this investing or this gambling?”

“Right now, with the frenzy we’ve had, to me, it feels much more like gambling.”

“Because it’s crazy?”

“I don’t find it to be rational, to be honest with you.”

“But investors keep flooding in. Why? Amazon snagged almost 2 million new customers at the end of last year. And like other internet companies, it’s growing much faster than those old blue chips.”

Recent interview with Jeff Bezos (https://www.you----.com/watch?v=hwskqpf0E6Y)

“Most of those companies of the dotcom era are out of business. You survived. What was it that made you to survive and virtually the rest of them are gone?”

Jeff: “Well, that whole period is very interesting, because the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock. So, as I watch the stock fall from 113 to 6, I was also watching all of our internal business metrics. Number of customers, profit per unit, umm, you know, everything you could imagine; defects, etc. Every single thing about the business was getting better - and fast.”

Let's take a closer look at XP Power.

Thread 🧵 ⬇️

**1) What does XP Power do?**

The company manufactures power converters for industrial electronics and medical equipment.

**2) Why is this so important?**

The converters in machines that make semiconductors or monitor patients in hospitals on the other hand are critical. Failure could halt a production line, or an operation.

**3) Why is this so profitable?**

Once an equipment manufacturer has chosen to use an XP Power converter, it should remain a customer for the machine’s lifetime.

**4) Does the business make good money?**

Hell yeah

＋High returns on capital and sales

\+Decent cash conversion

**5) Threats?**

The main threat is low-cost competition from Asia, which is eating away at XP Power’s soft underbelly..

**6) Solution?**

Moving to high voltage &amp; Green. As XP Power moves up the value chain, it is sloughing off parts of the business. It closed its low voltage design center in the UK. It also moved recently acquired high voltage manufacturing from Nevada USA to Vietnam.

**7) Green you say?**

Now the company is focusing manufacturing resources on more complex and profitable high-power converters and high-efficiency “Green Power” products. XP Green Power converters are 95% efficient, producing five times less waste energy than competitor suppliers

**8) Are the directors acting in the shareholders best interest?**

Yes,

\+ Founder and chairman owns 6% of the company

\+ Directors are experienced and committed shareholders

\+ They are also very well paid, but perhaps not extravagantly so

**Recent Results?**

Revenue increased 17%,

Adjusted profit rose 26%,

The outlook is good. Revenue was well ahead of the prior year and a strong order book even though demand from healthcare equipment manufacturers has subsided.

It's a solid company all around.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021.

# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after April’s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.
*****
&gt; Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week’s heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.
*****
&gt; Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday’s rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.
*****
&gt; “Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive.” He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.
*****
&gt; But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
*****
&gt; Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.
*****
&gt; He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.
*****
&gt; # Fed Ahead
&gt; The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before April’s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.
*****
&gt; That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. They’re thinking that one data point is not a trend,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.
*****
&gt; But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.
*****
&gt; Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.
*****
&gt; But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “We saw hot CPI, hot PPI,” said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. “That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.
*****
&gt; # Retail earnings and housing
&gt; Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowe’s release results Wednesday, and B.J.’s Wholesale and Kohl’s on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Another disappointing data point was Friday’s April’s retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.
*****
&gt; “You’re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s,” said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.
*****
&gt; Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.
*****
&gt; “The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications,” he said. “What’s good for home sales is good for auto sales. It’s good for Home Depot and Lowe’s.”
*****
&gt; Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.
*****
&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 held the 50-day moving average, which is constructive,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50-day, which is the average price of the last 50 closes. It is often a level that acts as support, but if it is broken, it can signal a negative trend.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down about 1.5% for the week at 4,173.85. The Nasdaq ended the week at 13,429.98, down 2.3% on the week.
*****
&gt; “The tech sector, which has been under pressure, held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week. Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week,” Redler said Friday. “It doesn’t mean you can go into everything, but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices.”

&gt; # 5 Charts We Are Watching

&gt; Last week’s monthly nonfarm payroll was disappointing, but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession, so maybe we shouldn’t have been so surprised. In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. “Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We don’t expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years. The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150%. Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.

&gt; We also keep an eye on the presidential cycle. We are now past President Biden’s first 100 days and choppy action with a new President in Office is perfectly normal right about now.

&gt; The financial press has discussed the well-known “sell in May and go away” market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isn’t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.

&gt; # NASDAQ 100 Finds Support

&gt; Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.

&gt; While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months – the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.

&gt; We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical “Reposition in May” period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.

&gt; Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.

&gt; If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.

&gt; In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.

&gt; # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks

&gt; We’ve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rally—this week notwithstanding—since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren’t pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.

&gt; Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&amp;P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Should strong performance by value stocks continue—and we suspect it might—international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance,“ explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.”

&gt; We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&amp;P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.

&gt; # Bullish Sentiment Down Big

&gt; The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&amp;P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&amp;P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&amp;P 500 trading higher across all time frames.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**

&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.

&gt; # ""Inflation"" Trends

&gt; You know it's getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter, but that's where we find ourselves this morning with the terms '#GasShortage2021' and '#inflation' both trending on our Twitter feed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**

&gt; On Google, the frequency of searches for the term inflation looks like it's on its own path straight to the moon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**

&gt; These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**

&gt; Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**

&gt; While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.

&gt; # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation

&gt; In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.

&gt; The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",1621075629,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021.

# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after April’s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.
*****
&gt; Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week’s heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.
*****
&gt; Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday’s rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.
*****
&gt; “Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive.” He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.
*****
&gt; But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
*****
&gt; Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.
*****
&gt; He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.
*****
&gt; # Fed Ahead
&gt; The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before April’s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.
*****
&gt; That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. They’re thinking that one data point is not a trend,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.
*****
&gt; But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.
*****
&gt; Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.
*****
&gt; But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “We saw hot CPI, hot PPI,” said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. “That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.
*****
&gt; # Retail earnings and housing
&gt; Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowe’s release results Wednesday, and B.J.’s Wholesale and Kohl’s on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Another disappointing data point was Friday’s April’s retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.
*****
&gt; “You’re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s,” said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.
*****
&gt; Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.
*****
&gt; “The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications,” he said. “What’s good for home sales is good for auto sales. It’s good for Home Depot and Lowe’s.”
*****
&gt; Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.
*****
&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 held the 50-day moving average, which is constructive,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50-day, which is the average price of the last 50 closes. It is often a level that acts as support, but if it is broken, it can signal a negative trend.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down about 1.5% for the week at 4,173.85. The Nasdaq ended the week at 13,429.98, down 2.3% on the week.
*****
&gt; “The tech sector, which has been under pressure, held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week. Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week,” Redler said Friday. “It doesn’t mean you can go into everything, but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices.”

&gt; # 5 Charts We Are Watching

&gt; Last week’s monthly nonfarm payroll was disappointing, but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession, so maybe we shouldn’t have been so surprised. In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. “Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We don’t expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years. The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150%. Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We also keep an eye on the presidential cycle. We are now past President Biden’s first 100 days and choppy action with a new President in Office is perfectly normal right about now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The financial press has discussed the well-known “sell in May and go away” market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isn’t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.

&gt; # NASDAQ 100 Finds Support

&gt; Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.

&gt; While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months – the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.

&gt; We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical “Reposition in May” period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.

&gt; Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.

&gt; If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.

&gt; In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.

&gt; # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks

&gt; We’ve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rally—this week notwithstanding—since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren’t pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.

&gt; Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&amp;P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Should strong performance by value stocks continue—and we suspect it might—international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance,“ explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.”

&gt; We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&amp;P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.

&gt; # Bullish Sentiment Down Big

&gt; The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&amp;P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&amp;P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&amp;P 500 trading higher across all time frames.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**

&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.

&gt; # ""Inflation"" Trends

&gt; You know it's getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter, but that's where we find ourselves this morning with the terms '#GasShortage2021' and '#inflation' both trending on our Twitter feed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**

&gt; On Google, the frequency of searches for the term inflation looks like it's on its own path straight to the moon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**

&gt; These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**

&gt; Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**

&gt; While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.

&gt; # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation

&gt; In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.

&gt; The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

stocks,Huya: severely undervalued.,"Huya: The most undervalued company in the market.

https://i.imgur.com/dVC4QND.jpg

What is Huya? 

Huya is the largest game streaming platform in all of China, it’s basically the Chinese equivalent of Twitch. 

Esports is absolutely huge in China, bigger than in the west, it’s like a real sport over there. They hold tourneys in giant $900m stadiums and offer substantial cash prizes to winners. This is an industry with strong tailwinds and we know there will only be massive growth for the foreseeable future.

The majority shareholder of Huya is Tencent, which is great news for Huya because they can buy exclusive streaming rights for all Tencent games like League of Legends and Dota2 as well as exclusive broadcast rights for tournaments, which is creating a very nice moat. Add the network effect and you can forget about anyone ever challenging Huya’s dominance in the industry. We all know Google and Microsoft could never even compete with Twitch despite sniping the largest streamers Ninja and Shroud, because the network effect for game streaming is just that strong.

So what makes Huya so undervalued?

Well, just look at these numbers:

Market Cap: $4b

Sales: $1.67b

P/S: 2.4

PE ratio: 28

PEG ratio: 0.3

2020 Revenue growth: 30%

2020 Earnings growth: 89%

5 yr revenue cagr: 20-30%

Cash: $1.6b

Debt: $0

Compare these with a somewhat similar company, Bilibili, the Youtube of China.

Market cap: $37b

Sales: $1.8b

P/S: 20.5

PE ratio: 0

PEG ratio: 0

2020 revenue growth: 50%

2020 earnings growth: -118%

5 yr revenue cagr: 35-45%

Cash: $2b

Debt: $1.29b

But why?

Huya had been hit with the perfect storm of terrible news. We all know tech and growth stocks are crashing right now because of inflation, add the fact that Chinese stocks are getting hammered right now because of the new regulations that threaten to delist some of the shadier Chinese companies out there. But that’s not all, there is something else holding this stock down, a pending merger with their largest competitor Douyu.

This potential merger would basically double Huya revenue instantly, double the cash on the balance sheet, while giving them a new market cap of roughly $7b, and they would instantly capture 80% of all game streaming market share in China. Basically a monopoly in a hyper growth industry. They could also increase margins substantially with no competition and no need to outbid competitors with large contracts to their streamers to keep them on the platform.

Under normal circumstances this potential merger would be the most bullish development of all time, but not today. The CCP really doesn’t like it. They don’t like Tencent buying up smaller companies within an industry, merging them together, and creating a monopoly. These days it seems like there is an article every day about how the Chinese government is really starting to crack down on Tencent and Alibaba. The Huya Douyu deal is at the center of all of that China stock FUD, and there is a real good chance that this merger gets blocked outright within the next month or two.

This is bad for Huya? 

Not really. Whatever happens, it’s good for Huya share price. Right now Huya is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. There are a large number of shorts looking to take advantage of the price difference between Huya and Douyu shares, Arbitrage shorts. They will have to cover either way once the merger decision is reached, leaving Huya to run higher once the merger FUD is over. Over time, Huya will rise to reflect the strong fundaments and growth of the company. 

This stock should be 5x the price it is today at a bare minimum.

What is Huya? 

Huya is the largest game streaming platform in all of China, it’s basically the Chinese equivalent of Twitch. 

Esports is absolutely huge in China, bigger than in the west, it’s like a real sport over there. They hold tourneys in giant $900m stadiums and offer substantial cash prizes to winners. This is an industry with strong tailwinds and we know there will only be massive growth for the foreseeable future.

The majority shareholder of Huya is Tencent, which is great news for Huya because they can buy exclusive streaming rights for all Tencent games like League of Legends and Dota2 as well as exclusive broadcast rights for tournaments, which is creating a very nice moat. Add the network effect and you can forget about anyone ever challenging Huya’s dominance in the industry. We all know Google and Microsoft could never even compete with Twitch despite sniping the largest streamers Ninja and Shroud, because the network effect for game streaming is just that strong.

So what makes Huya so undervalued?

Well, just look at these numbers:

Market Cap: $4b

Sales: $1.67b

P/S: 2.4

PE ratio: 28

PEG ratio: 0.3

2020 Revenue growth: 30%

2020 Earnings growth: 89%

5 yr revenue cagr: 20-30%

Cash: $1.6b

Debt: $0

Compare these with a somewhat similar company, Bilibili, the Youtube of China.

Market cap: $37b

Sales: $1.8b

P/S: 20.5

PE ratio: 0

PEG ratio: 0

2020 revenue growth: 50%

2020 earnings growth: -118%

5 yr revenue cagr: 35-45%

Cash: $2b

Debt: $1.29b

But why?

Huya had been hit with the perfect storm of terrible news. We all know tech and growth stocks are crashing right now because of inflation, add the fact that Chinese stocks are getting hammered right now because of the new regulations that threaten to delist some of the shadier Chinese companies out there. But that’s not all, there is something else holding this stock down, a pending merger with their largest competitor Douyu.

This potential merger would basically double Huya revenue instantly, double the cash on the balance sheet, while giving them a new market cap of roughly $7b, and they would instantly capture 80% of all game streaming market share in China. Basically a monopoly in a hyper growth industry. They could also increase margins substantially with no competition and no need to outbid competitors with large contracts to their streamers to keep them on the platform.

Under normal circumstances this potential merger would be the most bullish development of all time, but not today. The CCP really doesn’t like it. They don’t like Tencent buying up smaller companies within an industry, merging them together, and creating a monopoly. These days it seems like there is an article every day about how the Chinese government is really starting to crack down on Tencent and Alibaba. The Huya Douyu deal is at the center of all of that China stock FUD, and there is a real good chance that this merger gets blocked outright within the next month or two.

stocks,23% of Tesla's Q1 earnings were from Bitcoin trading - and they would have missed earnings otherwise,"23% of Tesla's Q1 earnings were from Bitcoin trading - and they would have missed earnings otherwise

Title says it all.

Tesla's earnings in the first quarter were $438 million.

$101 million (23%) of that came from selling Bitcoin for profit.

The other interesting part is that it would have been an earnings miss without the trading.

Did one make the other happen?

Considering the recent news about not allowing Bitcoin anymore, it's certainly a move worth mentioning.

stocks,Why I Think AMC Will Result In Bagholders,"Alright, this will be quite unpopular, but I don't buy this AMC will squeeze to the moon thesis for a few reasons.

Let’s look at liquidity:

AMC had $813m in cash as of 3/31/21. Since then they’ve raised $428m in fresh capital through share issuance, bringing up their total to $1.241b. This is good except their current cash burn is \~$300m/qtr which gives them 4 quarters of runway. I do think that as covid goes away completely (possibly by fall) that there’s a chance for this to stabilize. But there are a lot of variables to this such as timeline of opening and attendance rate once we are fully open.

Next there's the valuation:

Forget covid and let’s value them assuming everything returns to normal. Average adj. EBITDA between 2018-2019 was $850.3m. EV today using today’s stock price and 3/31/21 debt numbers is 16.1b, which gives us 18.9x EV/adj. EBITDA multiple. For comparison, the same multiple was 6.9x in 2018. So assuming things return perfectly to normal, AMC is still valued 2.7x what it was in 2018. The highest market cap that AMC had previous to this year was in 2017 when its market cap was 4.0b vs. 5.8b today.

Conclusion:

AMC is massively overvalued (who knew). Of course, everyone will point out this is a short squeeze opportunity like GME. However, there will probably never be another GME which once had 141% short interest at its peak vs. \~20% for AMC now. What that means is GME had a legitimate reason for its stock price to completely decouple from its fundamentals, AMC doesn’t, not to quite the extent of GME. There may be some squeezes here and there, but more players will join the short when they see how overvalued AMC is.

The current buying is predominantly from retail, and the CEO even boasted as much saying retail investors comprise of 80% of the share base. While people think this is a positive, I disagree. There is a reason institutional ownership is low and it means that while the stock price can certainly continue to go up, it will also shoot down just as fast, once everyone begins to exit. With a short interest of 20%, how are 80% of the people going to get out? Who are they going to sell to? In the end, it will just be a shifting of bags amongst the retail.

If I was the CEO of AMC, this would be the best scenario possible. I can continue to dilute share base and basically salvage my business which was on the verge of bankruptcy. I don’t doubt that AMC will not hesitate to issue new shares within the next year again unless their liquidity situation improves. It’s also why, I think, they would rather do an at-the-market offering rather than a subscribed offering to institutions.

A lot of people are propping this up as something of a fight for the common people against the hedgies, who have done all the wrong. I actually think this can be quite irresponsible it’s driving people to pour into AMC, basically like a Ponzi scheme.

stocks,I don't understand $TSLA,"I first began investing in TSLA in mid 2018. I bought some puts thinking that this company was outrageously overpriced; net loss every quarter in 2017, enormous overhead costs that keep growing, ridiculous and practically non-sensible P/E ratio and a CEO whom even back then I'm surprised has not been arrested already. Every fundamental about this company point to it being grossly overvalued yet the stock price just won't go down; it just kept skyrocketing. Eventually around early 2020, I caved in and bought some calls. I thought clearly the market saw something behind this company that I'm not seeing and there appears to be a lot of momentum so I figure I'd just join in on the FOMO. I made tens of thousands (maybe not a whole lot but a non insignificant amount) buying calls and it seemed like TSLA was going to the moon. To this day, I still don't understand why. The best explanation I've found is that people are investing the man himself, despite the Tesla the company being nothing unique even back in 2017-2018 and even less so now. 

  

Fast forward to early 2021. I still had 200 calls at $790 and TLSA suddenly began to crash. This company which showed unrelenting momentum suddenly started plummeting, costing me all my gains from before and then some. From what I read, it seems to be due to increased competition, slowdown of sales particularly in China and \[potentially\] manipulating earnings via BTC trades. Essentially, what I'm interpreting from the TSLA's current bear market is that the fundamentals have caught up, but it still begs the question: why now? Fully electric vehicles are not and have not been unique to Tesla; relying on sales from China is sketchy and incredibly risky especially with US-China relations at an all-time low even before COVID; and the company has had sketchy earnings quarters before but every time, the stock just seemed to bounce back and then some quickly after. The fundamentals that point to Tesla being a shit company were in from of us the whole time and just now the market decides to focus on that instead riding the FOMO? And what was the FOMO even about anyway? Musk may own other companies but do people actually think he's going to invest earnings from those companies into Tesla? At the end of the day, Tesla's business is selling cars and they've been struggling to fill orders.  

  

  

TL;DR what's the deal with TSLA? How can this stock that just kept going up suddenly lose so much momentum despite the underlying fundamentals being largely the same?  

  

  

Secondly, what's the view of TSLA now? I've spent a portion of my remaining funds on 100 puts at $510.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 14, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 14, 2021**

Stocks continued yesterday’s momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed’s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said all week that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend or is just bouncing.  

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Yesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents.

In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed’s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said all week that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend or is just bouncing.  

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Yesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents.

Most of the hires will be placed at the company fulfillment locations and network of local delivery centers after positioning its final-mile delivery network at the closest range of the end customers.

Amazon has 409 delivery stations in the U.S., out of which 344 support package deliveries and the rest support heavy, bulky items that are typically non-conveyable.

Amazon plans to build 229 additional delivery stations, out of which 193 are meant for packages. Amazon has 16 delivery stations in Canada, with seven more on the drawing board.

Amazon will offer several new employees a $1,000 signing bonus and an additional $100 to the vaccinated ones. Amazon offers on-site vaccinations at over 250 locations in the U.S. and Canada.

In April, Amazon announced an investment of over $1 billion for a wage hike of over 500,000 hourly employees by between 50 cents and $3 an hour.

Last year Amazon added over 500,000 workers globally, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The hiring comes just before the annual Prime Day shopping event, which was preponed from July to June.

Amazon continues to face employee flak for difficult work conditions in their warehouses including Alabama, and Chicago. The company has refuted the allegations and assured necessary efforts for improved working conditions.'

I am 20 and my current savings goals range from 15-40 years, so long term goals. 

I am not focusing on dividends, but if there’s a strong passive investing portfolio advice, that does pay a dividend I like three reinvest potential. 

My current portfolio is: 

VTI - 37%
SCHD - 30%
VXUS - 15%
VWO - 10%
ICLN - 5
 ___
REIT - 3%



Does this make sense with my risk tolerance and time horizon? 

If not, What advice do you have for adding a little more risk?

stocks,Selling a position before or after 1 year ownership,"I am hoping someone can tell me if I am thinking about this correctly.

I was pretty new to investing when the market crashed due to covid last year.  I bought a bunch of stocks (eg. CCL, DAL) without too much diligence just because they were down so far and I figured ""hey, this can't last forever!"".  Now as we get into May, most of them are hitting the 1 year point since purchase. 

I am looking to simplify my portfolio and own fewer tickers because I don't feel like I care to be invested in these companies anymore and I can't follow all of them.

Should I try to wait until 1 year after purchase? for instance I have a stock I purchased in April 2020.  If I wait to sell until next month, will I be better off on taxes (understanding that the prices could also move between now and then). My current thinking is if I wait one more month I will save 10% on taxes.

stocks,Retirement plan,"Long story short, I was talking to one local multi-millionaire and he told me the story behind his fortune when he was a bit tipsy. He's in his 60s. So, this guy claims he never was really the wealthiest guy out there, quite the opposite he was working hard to survive from month to month like most people, saving some small amounts of money to buy himself a car or house over the years. I was actually amazed because everyone knows that at the moment he's a multi-millionaire, so I asked him directly how is this possible that he's a millionaire if he never really got any fortune in his life, and that was the moment he told me   
'son, you're still young, I'll give you the advice I've had got from one of my late old friends back day. Put $100 on stocks every week, that's it. That's not much, you won't even feel it missing, but over the years your money will be stacking, and be growing over the years. That's how I became a millionaire after cashing it a few years ago.'   
He said that he invested in some copper company.  


This leads to a few questions:  
1) is such a strategy really worth it?  
2) if so what companies are worth putting your money into long term?  
3) should I go on the market alone \[via robinhood\] or perhaps use some investment groups?

So where does the money go when the market turns bearish? Is there any empirical evidence beyond ""Scared money buys gold.""

I keep seeing red swing days followed by big gains and I'm wondering how much of it is the simple fact that the money has no where to go but under a mattress and people don't feel comfortable with that plan because of inflation.

I believe this will cause the exact opposite of what should happen where you should always do your own research. 

Watching youtubers that have super risky options and stocks creates a confirmation bias to do the same thing as them whereas they have more capital than most of us, and they get paid a lot of money making these YouTube videos via google adworks.
In essence without doing a lot of your OWN research it’s basically gambling and you need to invest more cognitively.

stocks,Don't worry about the green days,"I have seen quite a few posts here about others just not dealing well with the good days. I understand that it can be hard to see a stock you've invested in go up so much. It can easily take hold of your emotions and cause you to make some pretty irrational choices. My advice to all of you during green days like this is the following:

* Look at your investments and see if anything has changed. If nothing has changed fundamentally, then it would make no sense to sell now.
* Look at your portfolio and see if you are heavy in any particular sector.. Readjust as necessary based on your risk tolerance.
* Lastly, don't look at the graphs all day. I know it is hard for me when I see green everywhere in my portfolio to not question my investing choices. However, it will only do you harm to keep looking at them all day. If your DD on a company has not changed and the price change is due to market volatility, then you have nothing to worry about for today.

Remember there will be green days like today, but there will also be red days in the future as well. Take days like today to step away for a bit.

stocks,Helpful Sources for Understanding the Lumber Industry and the Value of Lumber Companies,"People have been asking me a lot recently whether to jump ship or hold.  I can’t give financial advice, I am not a financial professional.  But I will share all the various sources I’ve used to keep myself educated on the industry and get my “feel” for long term exit strategies.

This post isn’t about doing EPS or IV projections.  It’s simply about how you can keep doing ongoing research about the general direction and prices of lumber the commodity, as well as any major news/opinions out there that could affect the commodity’s future direction.  

I find it **very** helpful, because on weeks like this one where everyone lost their fucking minds because the price of used cars went up a bit, I held strong because in the end I knew the CPI report and the panic selling that followed didn’t change the market fundamentals driving the lumber industry’s record profits.  I didn’t panic when futures went red the last few days, because I know how well these companies will do even if lumber prices drops another 30% and I knew that the cash markets were doing just fine.  So this “market feel” research helps you have confidence in your investment so you can ignore the daily noise.

**Basic Links for understanding the Current State of Lumber Industry**

I think it will be helpful for people to know exactly why lumber is surging and the market dynamics that caused it, because you can then use that to make educated guesses at whether your various companies still have long term value and have confidence in your investment when the fundamentals are still there.

Here are two excellent podcasts from two industry insiders discussing the current state of the industry:

(Odd Lots Podcast with Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean)[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-the-price-of-lumber-has-soared-day-after-day-after-day/id1056200096?i=1000518629853]

(Building Optimal Podcast with Dustin Jalbert; Fastmarkets RISI Senior Economist; Episode #71)[ https://buildingoptimal.com/episodes/]

Both are great podcasts to help you understand what’s causing the surge from the people that know.  Hint: it’s not due to an industry-wide conspiracy.  This will help you start to figure out whether you should stick with your investment when lumber dips from it’s high after the summer.


**Apparently Social Media Actually has a Positive Use**

I don’t use social media, but I got a twitter account for work related reconnaissance and then found out that a handful of extremely knowledge people in the lumber industry are tweeting at each other non-stop about things going on in the cash markets / futures, as well as the occasional opinions.  These people often post articles on the area or new podcasts.  So it’s a great way to keep yourself educated.  Also, they are just good people and it can be entertaining to see what’s going on with them any particular day.

It can be insightful (and calming on red days), especially since normal members of the public can’t see what’s happening in the cash markets real time, but sometimes these guys will let you know.  The other day, when all the futures were nose diving, cash markets were still up, meaning the immediate price of lumber was doing just fine and it the red was really from the speculators jumping ship (which is a good thing!).

(Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean)[https://twitter.com/LumberTrading?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor] – The King of Lumber Twitter.  Nice guy and great insights.  Don’t ask him what the price of lumber will be in Q4.  No one fucking knows.  

(RISI Senior Economist Dustin Jalbert)[https://twitter.com/2x4caster] – Also a very prolific poster in Lumber Twitter and will share great insights.

(Forestry Insider Bryan Davis)[ https://twitter.com/bryandav1z] – Another knowledgeable insider who likes to share insights on the industry and some of the main lumber stocks.

(Housing Market Reporter/Expert Ali Wolf)[ https://twitter.com/AliWolfEcon] – The housing market is driving this surge.  The lumber industry uses housing demand/data as the canary in the coal mind.  You probably should too.  If housing demand is still going bananas, then lumber will do so as well.

(Madison’s Lumber Prices)[https://twitter.com/LumberNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor] – They post Lumber Cash Prices, typically about 2 weeks behind, but that’s still way ahead of whenever the company’s next earnings statements, and provides a break down by the major types of lumber.  Sometimes you even get a video interview/update.

(RISI Analyst Bryan Smith)[https://twitter.com/bryansmithrisi?lang=en] – He tweets out when some of these forestry companies declare wood pulp price increases (which extra is a significant source of income for a lot of these companies).  I find it a helpful data point.

Those are main ones.  But if you follow these people enough, you will see them talking to other insightful people as well and sharing informative content.

**Publicly Open Websites That Help You get a Sense of Market Direction**

Here’s the link for lumber futures: (CME Lumber Futures)[https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html#] - This is the closest thing to a general market gauge of the lumber industry.  But this isn’t an exact predictor and this price is pegged to the Western SPF KD 2x4 #2&amp;Btr.  There are many different types of dimensional lumber, some cost more (like Eastern SPF) and some cost less (like Southern Yellow Pine – SYP).  But this can help you get a sense what the future outlook may look like generally.  But remember, these prices can change.  They can go up or down, these aren’t guarantees of the future price of lumber.  Just because January futures trading at 1100 doesn’t mean it will stay that way.

(Nasdaq Lumber futures Graph)[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs] – a nice little graph showing the general price of lumber futures at the time of each expiration.  Helps you get an idea for where we are historically.  Why is this important?  Because you can look at the 2018 levels, see how well these companies did then.  If our current price is HIGHER than the 2018 peak, then you really don’t need to panic.  

The industry’s breakeven price is generally around $400 mfbm.  2018 hit $600 for three weeks and it was a great year for them.  So maybe you don’t need to panic sell when the futures dip below **$1200** from their $1600/1700 peak.  What matters is where it settles.  Also, you can see that in 2020, the Price dropped hard and came right back up because demand was still booming like crazy.

(Madison’s Lumber Reports)[ https://madisonsreport.com/] If you hate twitter, here’s another way to look at cash prices for the main types of lumber.  Again, the free stuff is typically about 1.5-2 weeks old.

(US Housing Data Releases)[https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] – US Census release new data typically the third week of every month, posting the data from the prior month.  This is a HUGE stat in the lumber industry.  It helps you see what home construction rates will look like now and in the coming months (due to housing permit numbers which precede starts by 2-3 months).  When the number drops month after month, don’t panic. Make sure you consider other sources for context.  But a large drop over time, that’s when you know the party is over.

(Shanghai Pulp futures)[ https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices] – This isn’t lumber.  But most of the lumber companies also produce wood pulp and it makes up a large part of their income when doing well.  This is the closest thing to a price indicator for the general wood pulp market.  There are many different types of wood pulps, of varying price, but this is turning into a decent gauge of the general direction of the wood pulp market.  (Here’s a recent publication praising it and giving you more info on the current pulp market.)[https://www.fastmarkets.com/Media/Files/PRA/FMV2/pdfs/Promotional%20materials/The_future_of_China_pulp_futures.pdf]

**Non-Lumber Specific Tools**

(Open Insider)[ http://openinsider.com/] is a website that lets you look up the insider buying/selling of any stock.  

(Whale wisdom)[https://whalewisdom.com/] is another excellent website that lets you look and see which hedge funds own the stock your looking at.  Lets you know are they buying or selling en masse, calls or puts.  It gets their data from 13-F’s so it isn’t real time but it is a helpful data point nonetheless.

Overall, there is a lot of publicly available information that you can use to inform yourself on how the industry is going and if the immediate future is looking good or bad.  It may be a good idea to look at prior earnings presentations in whatever company your invested during the periods lumber was up, and see how they did at those prices.  That will help you gauge whether these companies will still do great even when lumber prices drop below $1K, because at some point they will.  Monetary policy/QE is not causing this.

If there is one place you *shouldn’t* go for insights on lumber stocks/industry, it’s Motley Fool / CNBC or frankly any of the tops results from google.  That free content is dogshit.  You can look at my post history to see how horribly off the mark these free websites are in recommending “lumber stocks.”  You are not the customer in their eyes, you are the product.  Keep that in mind.

TLDR: there is a lot of simple, free stuff out there to help you evaluate your investments or whether you should invest in lumber companies.  I am not a financial analyst or an industry insider.  Do your own research and make your own decisions.  Don’t panic sell because some internet dipshits who know nothing of this industry are calling the peak (but not backing that talk up with puts).  Don’t FOMO buy just because “the sucker’s going up.”

Disclosure: most of the stock I hold is in RFP, but I also hold some WFG and LPX.  Anyone have thoughts on what they like more LPX vs WFG long term (the next 6-18 months), please share and why.  I can’t decide which I want to buy more of.  For the Canfor/Interfor Bros out there, I don’t need to hear how cheap your otc stock is. :p",1620999841,"Helpful Sources for Understanding the Lumber Industry and the Value of Lumber CompaniesPeople have been asking me a lot recently whether to jump ship or hold.

They can go up or down, these aren’t guarantees of the future price of lumber.  Just because January futures trading at 1100 doesn’t mean it will stay that way.

(Nasdaq Lumber futures Graph)[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs] – a nice little graph showing the general price of lumber futures at the time of each expiration.  Helps you get an idea for where we are historically.  Why is this important?  Because you can look at the 2018 levels, see how well these companies did then.  If our current price is HIGHER than the 2018 peak, then you really don’t need to panic.  

The industry’s breakeven price is generally around $400 mfbm.  2018 hit $600 for three weeks and it was a great year for them.  So maybe you don’t need to panic sell when the futures dip below **$1200** from their $1600/1700 peak.  What matters is where it settles.  Also, you can see that in 2020, the Price dropped hard and came right back up because demand was still booming like crazy.

(Madison’s Lumber Reports)[ https://madisonsreport.com/] If you hate twitter, here’s another way to look at cash prices for the main types of lumber.  Again, the free stuff is typically about 1.5-2 weeks old.

(US Housing Data Releases)[https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] – US Census release new data typically the third week of every month, posting the data from the prior month.  This is a HUGE stat in the lumber industry.  It helps you see what home construction rates will look like now and in the coming months (due to housing permit numbers which precede starts by 2-3 months).  When the number drops month after month, don’t panic. Make sure you consider other sources for context.  But a large drop over time, that’s when you know the party is over.

(Shanghai Pulp futures)[ https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices] – This isn’t lumber.  But most of the lumber companies also produce wood pulp and it makes up a large part of their income when doing well.  This is the closest thing to a price indicator for the general wood pulp market.  There are many different types of wood pulps, of varying price, but this is turning into a decent gauge of the general direction of the wood pulp market.  (Here’s a recent publication praising it and giving you more info on the current pulp market.)[https://www.fastmarkets.com/Media/Files/PRA/FMV2/pdfs/Promotional%20materials/The_future_of_China_pulp_futures.pdf]

**Non-Lumber Specific Tools**

(Open Insider)[ http://openinsider.com/] is a website that lets you look up the insider buying/selling of any stock.  

(Whale wisdom)[https://whalewisdom.com/] is another excellent website that lets you look and see which hedge funds own the stock your looking at.  Lets you know are they buying or selling en masse, calls or puts.  It gets their data from 13-F’s so it isn’t real time but it is a helpful data point nonetheless.

Overall, there is a lot of publicly available information that you can use to inform yourself on how the industry is going and if the immediate future is looking good or bad.  It may be a good idea to look at prior earnings presentations in whatever company your invested during the periods lumber was up, and see how they did at those prices.  That will help you gauge whether these companies will still do great even when lumber prices drop below $1K, because at some point they will.  Monetary policy/QE is not causing this.

If there is one place you *shouldn’t* go for insights on lumber stocks/industry, it’s Motley Fool / CNBC or frankly any of the tops results from google.  That free content is dogshit.  You can look at my post history to see how horribly off the mark these free websites are in recommending “lumber stocks.”  You are not the customer in their eyes, you are the product.  Keep that in mind.

TLDR: there is a lot of simple, free stuff out there to help you evaluate your investments or whether you should invest in lumber companies.  I am not a financial analyst or an industry insider.  Do your own research and make your own decisions.  Don’t panic sell because some internet dipshits who know nothing of this industry are calling the peak (but not backing that talk up with puts).  Don’t FOMO buy just because “the sucker’s going up.”

Disclosure: most of the stock I hold is in RFP, but I also hold some WFG and LPX.  Anyone have thoughts on what they like more LPX vs WFG long term (the next 6-18 months), please share and why.  I can’t decide which I want to buy more of.  For the Canfor/Interfor Bros out there, I don’t need to hear how cheap your otc stock is. :p",10334,87,10247

Coindesk's director of research Noelle Acheson explains to Yahoo Finance why Elon Musk's recent comments regarding Bitcoin and sustainable energy were more layered than it may have initially appeared.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/video/musks-comments-bitcoin-were-four-010125429.html

--------------

I think she makes a very interesting case for why Tesla's move is both a positive for BTC as well as not a negative for Tesla. Essentially what she's saying is:

* Buying a Tesla with BTC was just a PR stunt in the first place. The whole idea about BTC (today) is that it's a store of value, so why would people want to buy a car with it? Plus anyone who really wants to do so can still sell his BTC for USD and buy the car that way. So (temporarily) disabling that option doesn't actually matter much at all for Tesla nor BTC.
* But, by removing this option because of sustainability concerns, they publicly put more emphasis on the environmental impact of Bitcoin and may encourage sustainable mining. After all, bad PR is bad for BTCs price and the profitability of the mining.
* Meanwhile, Tesla is still keeping their $1,5B worth of BTC on their balance sheet. They bought this because they wanted an asset that has a high liquidity, but doesn't suffer from inflation and preferably even has a potential ROI. Musk said they are not selling any, so their decision didn't change anything about their strategy.

So all in all, this whole saga may help BTC to become more sustainable, while Tesla still has $1,5B worth of assets that is not diminishing due to inflation, has a potential ROI and can be liquidated at any time they require the funds.",1620994648,"Interesting take on Tesla's recent BTC move by Coindesk's director of research Noelle Acheson**Musk's comments on Bitcoin were a ""four-dimensional chess move""**

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

*Idea*: I believe inflation will be short lived and we will revert to a deflationary environment in less than two years. Briefly, the rationale behind that is (1) stimulus checks/helicopter money programs will end, (2) the supply chain will go back to full capacity and demand will be met by offer, (3) no countries have implemented long standing relief programs, (4) demographics are going down and labor cost is going up, (5) globalization is increasing competition between companies, keeping prices down, (6) technological advancements push prices down.

You can agree or disagree with such an idea, but we are not here to assess whether I’m a moron or not.


*Question*: how do I bet on deflation? The idea I had was to take the short side of some of the inflation assets, but a short play is not sustainable for a retail investor on the long term due to daily fees.

I made a promise to never touch options again. I know stocks have the potential to give me financial freedom by retirement given how young I am now.

Any opinions and advice would be greatly appreciated. 

My thought process now is if I do decide to stay in the market then take a few month break, create a savings account for me THEN invest a different portion, and switch to a web-based broker so I’m less attempted to take any action through my phone during the day. And play ETFs long term only.

stocks,fundamental conflict between cyclicals and long term capital gains,"This rotation away from tech has me thinking.  Investors are encouraged to hold stocks for at least a year before selling on a lower rated capital gains tax.   Yet, by the nature of cyclical trends (\~6-8 months from what I am seeing), it is very difficult not to sell before the rotation.   Its also very hard to tell if you have a unicorn or not because ALL stocks seem to withdraw due to the cyclical rotation and its a crapshoot where you will end up (see 3 examples below).   That seems to be the hardest part of investing.   

$CRSP:  Bought at $35 March 2021.   High was $200ish.   Fell under $100 recently

$DNMR:  Bought at $19 around October 2021 I think.   High was $63.  Now at $16.   I dumped my DNMR at $20.     

$NIO:  Bought at $10.   High was 55 I think?   Now at 30 and possibly headed down to 27. 

My point is that its very challenging to hold for a year bc you dont know what the cyclical rotation will do to your stock and the cyclical rotation seems to last quite a long time.   Will you still be up?   Will you be back to square one?   Will you be approaching a loss?    

It seems to me that this whole cyclical rotation makes it a real challenge to hold for a year for long term capital gains.

During the annual shareholders meeting on March 9, Disney announced 100 million D+ subscribers.

Q2 ended April 3. Disney reports 103.6 million D+ subscribers. This growth of 3.6 million over a month is pretty on pace with the 3 million per month between January and March.

The average forecast from analysts was 109 million D+ subscribers. Are these analysts completely ignoring data provided directly by Disney? This estimate miss is by far the biggest narrative from Disney's earnings and is in every headline. I don’t get how they can be so off, and the market selling off in response. 

I can only assume these analysts looked at Q4 2020 to Q1 2020 (73.7 to 94 million subscribers) and based something off that. But analysts not only should know better, they do. I researched bearish analysts on Disney after their Q1 results, and they were all aware this large bump for Q1 came from Disney’s purchasing of Hotstar in India.

stocks,What did I do wrong investing in commodities during the inflation?,"Hey guys, I’m trying to figure out what I did wrong here. Are commodities something we shouldn’t invest in during an inflation?

FYI, I’m new to this, just started last week. When I was looking into what stocks to invest in, I kept reading news about the fear of inflation, which eventually was confirmed yesterday with the CPI report. 

But prior to this, while doing my research and reading about the fear of inflation, I looked up what kind of stocks to invest in during an inflation, and 'commodities' seemed to be a very common answer. 

So looking at companies dealing in commodities, I narrowed my list down to $CLF, $FCX, and $WY. I did see that they were trading at their all time highs at the time, so I read into their outlook, which basically said that given the rise in demand in the commodities they deal in and the bottleneck in supply, these stocks should continue their trend this year. So I got a few call options- 1xCLF 5/21 $20C, 2xCLF 5/28 $22.5C, 1xFCX 5/28 $43C, 1xWY 5/28 $39.5C- all by Monday morning. 

Well… yesterday I got destroyed, but I chalked that up to the overall market being down. Today however, was also a blood bath. Why? Like it isn’t even about the money here- this is money I’m willing to lose. It's about the knowledge- what did I do wrong and how can I learn from this? That’s where I’m stumped. I don’t even know where to start looking lol",1620949127,"What did I do wrong investing in commodities during the inflation?Hey guys, I’m trying to figure out what I did wrong here.

stocks,Investment opportunity of a lifetime,"With so much uncertainty in the energy market, billions of dollars are being spent in research and development of renewable fuels and energy sources.  One untapped market, I feel, is critically undervalued:

Whale oil 

Yes, it is an antiquated fuel source that has not been relevant in over a hundred years; but to date it remains the only source of fossil fuel that is capable of biological reproduction – thus it is a sustainable, natural fuel source.

Whale oil has a low viscosity and is exceptionally stable, it also has a relatively high flash point (230 degrees C/446 degrees F) which makes transportation and storage safer and easier than petroleum, natural gas and other fuels, such as coal.

I still need to do more research on the refining process, but believe this could be an alternative fuel source that has limitless potential. 

One country, and one company in particular, has cornered this potential market with the world’s only remaining whaling fleet:  Kyodo Senpaku Co., of Japan.

http://www.kyodo-senpaku.co.jp/

Founded in 1987 and resuming whaling operations as of July 1, 2019, Kyodo Senpaku Co. owns and operates the Nisshin Maru, the worlds only whaler factory ship.  This ship is over 8 k gross tons and 425 ft long – supported by a fleet of smaller whaling vessels, they have the only means to harvest whales currently.  Currently, Kyodo Senpaku’s mission statement revolves around establishing whales as a food source – they estimate world population to exceed 9 billion by 2050, and concerns of a global food shortage necessitate food diversity using sustainable marine resources (whales). 

To meet this market need, they have plans to expand and are spending 6 billion yen to construct a new whaling mother ship, which should begin operation by 2024 and replace the aging Nisshin Maru.  The new ship will be capable of navigating Antarctic waters and harvesting Fin whales, which are the 2nd largest species of whale on earth, following the endangered blue whale.  Fin whales grow to an average length of 61-66 feet and weigh between 38-50 tonnes.  I do not know how much oil one would yield, but imagine it is a substantial amount.    

While their company is centered around the harvest of whales as a food source, I have established a correspondence with their investor relations department regarding the use of whale oil as a fuel source.  While early communication has been tedious due to the language barrier (I know little to no Japanese), I am hopeful that this will bear fruit.    

Kyodo Senpaku is publicly traded on the Tokyo stock exchange – 9849.T – shares trade for 4800.00 Yen.  At todays exchange rate, that comes to $43.68 a share.  A market cap of over 3 billion yen translates to just over $29 million in USD – shares are exceptionally cheap for a company that really has unlimited long term growth potential.

With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears inflation, marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday, are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters confidence in the Fed’s claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports. Again though, with so many factors revolving around the market, it is difficult to see the clear picture.

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.17% up after closing 2.09% down yesterday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.77% up after closing 2.54% down yesterday. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.26% up after closing 2% down yesterday. 

Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Today, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown. Looking ahead though, I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near term. Just my two cents.

stocks,The 5-2-3 Strategy: My favorite and most profitable way to invest,"For the last few months I’ve been tinkering with and studying a bevy of different TA Indicators for finding stocks to invest in just before the price takes off and selling just before it falls. Well no shit, it’s something we all try to do. I tried to keep it simple and experimented with EMA and Bollinger Bands.

 One trend that I found over and over again was when I used 5 Day EMA while following the prices day by day.  There were essentially 3 spikes that would happen in the lifespan of a price taking off. First, the 5 EMA would [start by “hugging” the top Bollinger Band](https://imgur.com/axWwcy0) this would be the indicator of one of the three hikes. To confirm this was a real hike and not a dummy, I employed the 2 Day EMA to confirm. In order for it to be confirmed, the 2 Day EMA would need to [break out of the Bollinger Band for roughly 3 trading days](https://imgur.com/bCuJpoh). This was by no means an overall confirmation to invest. The confirmation usually comes 1.5 to 2 months following the first spike when the exact same process happens again. Following the second confirmation we follow the price and make a decision when to jump in just as a dip occurs. We have 100% confidence that a third spike is coming and can ride that into a profit.


Obviously we should not employ this strategy into incredibly volatile stocks but it has been very successful for me thus far. Let’s take a look at some examples of the 5-2-3 Strategy at work:

&amp;nbsp;

Here is [Netflix in 2015](https://imgur.com/GPPOToX)


Here is [Amazon in 2015](https://imgur.com/zhonAVu)


Here is [NVIDIA in 2017](https://imgur.com/gxdeP9V)


Also crypto has fallen into the 5-2-3 

&amp;nbsp;

And finally to another recent stock: GME. In late August 2020 [the first spike occurred and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/W3tjDL6), 2.5 months later [the second happened and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/gMyNebx), then the price [took off and probably could’ve topped out at $50-60](https://imgur.com/s4ZY2Lw) but the insanity took hold and the rest is history.

stocks,Ameritrade flagged sale as a wash trade when I never bought back in,"I’ve done a ton of research and am at a loss, so I’m going to try here.

I bought 50 shares of a stock starting January 11 and then purchased 40 more on February 10, which was my last purchase date.  I sold 40 shares on March 8, which is the only time I ever sold. I technically lost 1,049.80, but the wash sale rule was triggered and that amount was added to my cost basis. 

I called into Ameritrade in March asking for an explanation. The customer service rep said it was a standard wash sale violation and I was confused but figured I was missing something so I took him at his word. 

After doing more research I called back in April and the rep said it was absolutely a mistake by Ameritrade and the wash sale rule should not have been triggered because I never bought back in. He said it would be fixed within 2 weeks. It had not been fixed as of today, so I called back and was told that it actually was a wash sale. The rep said he was not aware prior to looking into it that what I did could trigger the wash sale rule, but it technically was one. I asked if that meant that you can never sell at a loss within 30 days of purchasing a stock without triggering the wash sale rule, and he said yes. I told him I’d do more research and call back if I still thought Ameritrade made a mistake.

At this point I’m not sure what to do. I’m not really concerned about the money but I refuse to believe that buying and selling at a loss, without ever buying back in, is a wash sale. 1 of 3 Ameritrade reps agrees with me. The other says this is the first time he’s ever heard of this rule. Does anyone have any insight on what I’m missing?

I personally think, that if from China to the US everybody is on board with changing the energy production to renewables and the strong development of the sector despite the pandemic in 2020, it should be very likely, that we see at least a strong decade for renewable energy stocks.  


While researching what stocks are best positioned to profit from Governments trying to make a switch in energy production and at the same time are relatively stable during inflation and rising interest rates, I came to the conclusion, that I wanted to invest in companies that are already profitable an so well financed, that they are able to pay out dividends.  


While the US market is relatively small for such companies, countries that are more advanced in their energy production do have some stocks that fit. Europe, Canada and China are clearly ahead in renewables and I would love to get some inspiration on where to look for more companies like this.

A couple of people laughed saying that the field of electric vehicles would get crowded and Tesla stock wouldn't really go up like it's highest high.

If I had 25K to spare and would wait 5-10 years, would it be worth getting Tesla stock?

Over a roughly 2 week period, I bought shares of a stock between $18.85 and $23.50. A week later, I sold all shares for $23.63.

So, a few questions. Isn't wash sale only applicable on sales for a net loss?

stocks,$DGX Undervalued and now even has a Short Squeeze play,"I've been posting ongoing analysis for $DGX (Quest Diagnostics) for the past 3 months. Not allowed to link, so see post history for additional **non** short interest related deep dives. Although the returns have already been excellent during this time, I stumbled across some additional data over the past 48hrs that make $DGX Quest Diagnostics even more enticing. Astonishingly, short interest has TRIPLED recently. No, this isn't your 50%+ short **obvious** short squeeze play, but hear me out. This short interest is a suicide play that's flying under the radar.

* $DGX is a relatively low volume stock. Hence this tripling of short interest has resulted in a Days to Cover ratio of 8.6. For perspective, Days to Cover is below 1 for both G.M.E and A.M.C.
* 8.6 Days to Cover is ABSURDLY high for a safe blue chip stock with elite financials and tons of cash on hand. Again, for even more perspective, close competitor $LH Labcorp sits at 1.9.
* Now here's the icing on the cake. The cherry on top. The tug after the massage:
   * **93% of $DGX float is owned by institutions**. After recent buybacks, their float presently sits at 130m shares, 121m of which is owned by institutions.
      * Vanguard is the largest holder. Blackrock recently increased their large stake as well. Safe dividend stock = low churn from institutions. They hold.
   * $DGX recently approved $1.5 billion ASR (accelerated share repurchase), meaning they are GUARANTEED to repurchase nearly 10% of float by Q4: roughly 10 to 11 MILLION shares.

**Napkin crayon math:** Present float of 130m LESS low churn institutional holdings = ""Retail"" is playing with 10m shares. The ASR alone requires the repurchasing of 10 million shares. Now add in that short interest recently spiked to 11 million shares.

**Result (TL;DR):** Assuming institutions continue to mostly hold this safe dividend, blue chip stock with incredibly strong financials and a mountain of cash on hand, the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase alone would propel this stock upwards. Throw the massive short interest spike on top and $DGX can run. This is honestly one of the dumbest short positions I've ever come across in the market. It is a suicide mission with high risk, minimal reward ($130 is rock bottom floor for this stock based on their financial position alone). It's so irrational that when I first saw it 2 days ago, I assumed it was a typo. It's also too large to simply be a hedge. **See previous DDs for non short interest related analysis.**

Would like to hear some counterarguments before I begin to go on a shopping spree; I’m sure many users here know way more about this than me and can provide some great food for thought.

Basically, a lot of growth stocks have been pummeled mainly due to A) sector rotation into reopening plays and B) fears of inflation. The first has no tangible impact on a company’s fundamentals. The inflation hysteria does makes sense, as a lot of growth stocks tend to reinvest excess cash flow and that makes them more vulnerable to interest rate movements. 

But with many of these growth stocks currently being decimated by levels of 50% or more, you have to wonder how much of that is priced in, and should inflation normalize over the coming months, these stocks should see a pretty massive jump in positive sentiment. I’m pretty confident that inflation fears are a nothingburger, making this an excellent entry point for someone like me who has withheld a lot of gunpowder on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity to invest during a tech correction. If inflation does turn out to be a more long-term issue then, again, the stocks are already down 40-50 percent. Don’t see how much more they can reasonably fall.

stocks,I want to track your scraper,"Everyone and their brother has a Reddit sentiment scraper these days, and I have tracked many of them to varying degrees of success. For a while I was doing great with Unbias, but it hasn't updated in a while so I started tracking Unusual Whales. Lately even they aren't updating their sentiment side anymore.

The Wisdom of the Masses basically says that if 100k people on Reddit think a certain stock is going to go up tomorrow, most of the time it will. Harnessing the power of Reddit sentiment worked incredibly well for me until the scrapers stopped updating (see bonafides below). The opinions of thousands of people, each having done their own version of DD, is a strong data set that points to which types of stocks to buy next.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonafides:**

* [First round of tracking Unbias and Finviz ATH data](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mfs7dp/stock_scraper_update_as_of_032921/)
* [Second](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/) [round of tracking Unbias](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Third round of tracking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n5lec2/results_of_30_days_of_tracking_all_reddit/)
* I've also tracked a lot of other things (Twitter ""gurus"", StockTwits, etc, etc, etc)
* [Imgur site with screen shots of previous success based off sentiment trading](https://imgur.com/user/rwmcrae)

&amp;#x200B;

The problems I've run into are either the tickers don't provide enough data to point us in a good direction of which stocks to buy, they do provide good data but not in an easily-downloadable or copy-able format, or they just stop updating after a while

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like to do is work with someone who can scrape Reddit financial subs and return some sort of version of this data:

* Ticker symbol

I'd do it myself but honestly I figure it'll take longer to learn to do the programming myself than it'd take to find someone who wants to team up. I'm a data guy by education and profession so crunching numbers is my skill. The goal isn't to find a ""trick"" or system, it's just to analyze the data long enough to find categories of stocks that are good buys. When Unbias was up and running I'd spread money across 5 stocks in the highest profitability categories and about 90% of the time turn a profit of at least 6% - 15% a week on them. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't a scam or someone to do all the work, it's me looking for a partner who can do the programming and I can do the number crunching. Hell, I don't even care if you make a page with ads and want to keep that revenue money for yourself. I just want a reliable scraper so I can get back to consistent profits.",1620921262,"I want to track your scraperEveryone and their brother has a Reddit sentiment scraper these days, and I have tracked many of them to varying degrees of success. For a while I was doing great with Unbias, but it hasn't updated in a while so I started tracking Unusual Whales. Lately even they aren't updating their sentiment side anymore.

The Wisdom of the Masses basically says that if 100k people on Reddit think a certain stock is going to go up tomorrow, most of the time it will. Harnessing the power of Reddit sentiment worked incredibly well for me until the scrapers stopped updating (see bonafides below). The opinions of thousands of people, each having done their own version of DD, is a strong data set that points to which types of stocks to buy next.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonafides:**

* [First round of tracking Unbias and Finviz ATH data](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mfs7dp/stock_scraper_update_as_of_032921/)
* [Second](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/) [round of tracking Unbias](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Third round of tracking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n5lec2/results_of_30_days_of_tracking_all_reddit/)
* I've also tracked a lot of other things (Twitter ""gurus"", StockTwits, etc, etc, etc)
* [Imgur site with screen shots of previous success based off sentiment trading](https://imgur.com/user/rwmcrae)

&amp;#x200B;

The problems I've run into are either the tickers don't provide enough data to point us in a good direction of which stocks to buy, they do provide good data but not in an easily-downloadable or copy-able format, or they just stop updating after a while

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like to do is work with someone who can scrape Reddit financial subs and return some sort of version of this data:

* Ticker symbol
* Some sort of score or ranking based on Reddit popularity. The more data we can use for this (like amount of flair, or amount of mentions in a thread, number of threads it pops up in, etc) the better
* How much the score changed from yesterday to today

Identiv designs and manufactures millions of low-cost RFID chips that enable the internet of things “IOT”, offering highly tuned and optimized antennas, systems, software and security. Identiv has been selling [smart ID and perimeter access card systems](https://www.identiv.com/products/physical-access-control/hardware/freedom-access-control-hardware/) to institutions including the [federal government ](https://www.identiv.com/us-government-ficam-solution/)for many years, and is now seeing high growth in [other verticals](https://www.identiv.com/products/rfid-nfc-inlays/hf-inlays-tags/) such as [prescription drugs with CVS](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/cvs-pharmacy-app-introduces-feature-people-visual-impairments).

I expect compound annual sales growth of over +20-25% for several years with huge near term upside driven by opportunities in high-tech syringes and cannabis (particularly Canada). The company has recently launched a Developers Kit to help customers find more use cases, for which INVE can prototype quickly. Over the past year, manufacturing capacity has increased +70% from 130 million units to 220 million units, and [management has commented recently](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963) “That's not even a lot of buffer for what we're seeing as our baseline demand”.

As of 5/12, the stock is trading at $14, a valuation of 3x Enterprise Value / 2022E Forward Sales of $120M. With high visibility for 20-25% sales growth, I believe the stock today is worth $26 based on 5x Forward Sales. If Identiv delivers on their pipeline of smart syringes, cannabis labeling and other innovative products, sales will exceed $250 million by 2024 and the stock will trade \*significantly higher\* than where it is today. As the world gets more digital, I expect INVE will sell billions of NFC tags configured for [countless applications](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/the-need-for-enabling-touchless-technologies-whitepaper.pdf).

stocks,Dividend vs growth comparison,"Alright, so I am mostly in VTI/index funds but have some dividend stocks as well. I know some people say that dividends don’t make any sense because stock drops in value and you lose growth. I was trying to figure out how much I would lose in my dividend stocks so I did a very very simple math exercise below. I kind of proved myself wrong here. 

Can you guys take a look and let me know what I got wrong?  I am assuming 15% tax bracket and I am assuming that other growth is identical between these stocks. So I am not factoring that in. I am just reflecting the dividend portion. 

1.  Let’s say I want to start living off dividends from some of my stocks in 10 years. Let’s say I have $100 and invest in a 5% div stock and I reinvest it all. But I pay 15% div tax rate every year so I only get to reinvest 4.25% and the other .75% gets lost as tax. 

100*1.0425^10 = $152. So I have $152 and I will start taking my 5% dividends. 

$152*.0425 = $6.46 income per year after 15% div tax. 

2.  Now by contrast I invest in a stock that doesn’t pay 5% dividend. So everything else being equal it just grows by 5% every year. 

100*1.05^10 = $163.  Obviously higher than $152.  But I then have to sell this growth stock and move it into a dividend stock to start living off my income. I realize long-term capital gains tax which is the same as dividend tax so 15%.

I now have $163*.85 = $139

5% of dividends minus 15% div tax is $139*4.25% = $5.91

stocks,An interesting theory,"The other day I was doing some research, and I came across a theory that says something along the lines of ""the median position on a topic will almost always be the correct one."" And I was curious to see if that applies to stocks too. Obviously, if I was able to do a sample size of everyone in the world, and weight it based on how much money they had behind their position, it would absolutely be a correct answer, however, I can't really do that. So, I was wondering how effective a smaller unweighted sample size would be. 

Lets test this out with AT&amp;T (T).

If you think AT&amp;T will be up by 4:30 today(5/13/2021), please say ""up"" followed by the percentage you think it will go up by.

stocks,Another inflation gauge comes in hot with producer prices jumping 6.2% in April from a year ago,"U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in April in another hotter-than-expected inflation report Thursday.

The Producer Price Index rose 0.6% last month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The gauge spiked 6.2% for the 12 months ended in April, marking the largest increase since the agency started tracking the data in 2010.

Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% increase in April for the PPI over the previous month. Year over year, the index was forecast to rise by 3.8%, according to FactSet.

The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like foods, energy and trade services, rose 0.7% in April from the previous month and jumped 4.6% year over year. The increase from a year ago was the biggest jump since 2014 with the department first calculated the data.

The Producer Prices Index came into focus after Wednesday’s consumer prices report showed hotter-than-expected inflation and triggered a big sell-off in the stock market.

The Labor Department reported that the prices American consumers pay for goods and services accelerated at their fastest pace since 2008 last month with the Consumer Price Index spiking 4.2% from a year ago.

Producer prices measure the prices paid to producers as opposed to prices on the consumer level.

First of all thank you for all your suggestions last time I created a post. I used your tips and current swing is much less nerve wrecking for me.

I was wondering - with markets falling and streets going red again, what are your current moves? Hold and don’t inject money into the market now, leave  the market and wait for better days or BTD (buy the dip)?

As for me: I just hold and don’t check my portfolio. I’m tech heavy, out of money to buy the dips, and too red to sell and take the loss.

stocks,Schwab discounted interest rates,"I saw awhile back somebody on this sub mentioned the schwab partnership with quicken loans that offers reduced interest rates (up to .75%) on loans when you have certain amounts of money invested on their platform (250k, up to 5 million)
Some back story on me, I am a 20 year old real estate investor who sold off his stock portfolio at 18 when he got into real estate. However, I fully intend on re-entering equities no later than by the time I am 25. In the mean time, I’ve been doing research on different companies (fidelity, schwab etc) and different investment strategies. So far, I am leaning towards choosing fidelity as my brokerage. HOWEVER, this reduced interest thing sounds like it could be hugely beneficial to me as real estate will always be a large percentage of my portfolio.
What I’m asking for is for anybody to share any expierences they’ve had with either this specific Schwab program or with the company in general.
Specifically, I would like to know:
1. Is there a limit to how many discounted morgages you can carry?
2. Is 20% down adequate for these loans or would you have to put down more to reap the full discounted benefits?
3. What is the approval like for this program? Is a 720 credit score adequate? Do you need above average DTI ratio or other metrics?
4. In general, is this program worth choosing Schwab for, assuming you take full advantage of it?

I’m planning to have above a million in assets invested in whichever brokerage I choose at some point in my life which would qualify me to take advantage of the .5% off morgage rates. I doubt I will reach the 5 million mark, but you never know!

*Earlier in 2021, Lexus unveiled the LF-Z, a conceptual look at the future of BEVs in the luxury segment. That was followed by the debut of the Toyota bZ4X concept, a battery electric SUV that will go into production in 2022.*

stocks,"How I turned 10k into 50k with mainly pennystocks/meme stocks, what did it cost and why I decided to move to an ETF","I decided to make this post since this community basically changed my life in the last 6 months.

**What this money means to me**

For context of this post, I'm not from USA, I live in a country where minimum wage is 300$/month and the average wage is around 700$/month. So 50k is A LOT of money here. I work in SWE so I already earn around top 5% in my country, but not even close to what SWEs in America earn.

**August 2019**

I started trading in August 2019 with 500$ in my broker. I was buying the most vanilla stocks I could (KO, AAPL, MSFT, DIS) and got hooked once when my portofolio was up 10% at some point and I sold everything, banking 50$. I went out to a restaurant and basically payed it all with money I made ""tapping some buttons on my phone"". To me, that was game changing. It was like gambling, but with way less risk. Like, What are the chances that those 4 companies would disappear and I would lose all my money overnight? Basically 0.

Fast forward to 2020. I was adding money monthly to my account and traded vanilla stocks for little profit. I was reading /r/wallstreetbets daily but didn't bother gambling all my money on meme stocks. Untill I decided to give it a try and bought RCL based on some DDs that it will recover during summer and ships will start sailing again. I placed all my money in this stock and held for a week. It went up ~30% and I made 2k dollars. I made more than my monthly salary by, again, ""tapping buttons on my phone"". This is when I knew I'd become a degenerate gambler.

**2019-2020**

Up until november 2020 I continued gambling with meme stocks from WSB while also adding money monthly. Gambled with SPCE, PLTR, PRPL and all the hot shit at that time. I was basically breaking even since I'd make 10% this week and lose 10% next week. My friend got into trading at this time. I had 10k in my account, he had 200$. So, since he had little money, he started dabbling with pennystocks.

December 2020: I was talking to my friend daily about penny stocks and he bought AIpine 4 technologies worth all his money and that 200$ in one month turned into 2k$. He made 1000% in one month. I've never heard of a stock moving 1000% in a month in my life before. Only meme coins would do that. So, being the degenerate I am, I moved to penny stocks.

**December 2020**

I had 10k$ to start with. I was reading this sub daily and throwing my money to random tickers that were mentioned every day. AßML was the first big money I made. I was reading the DD on this sub, crosschecking with other people on stocktwits/yahoo finance. Checking out myself the website etc (what everyone told you to do, not blindly follow random DDS) and in the end deciding to buy or not. I made 8k in December 2020. From 10k to 18k. 

**January 2021**

This was the month. The peak of my performance and decline of my mental health. I was less and less curious about checking if the DD is good or not. I was looking at an upvoted post, checking the top comment and throwing ~5k into that stock. I was reading this sub, the S -P -A -C -S subreddit, following dozen youtubers and was basically doing this 10-12 hrs a day. While at work, I'd check the premarket all day, refreshing every sub on new, looking at marketwatch and preparing my moves. It got to the point where I would not sleep at night because all I could think about were stocks. I was buying tickers that I didn't even know what the acronym standed for, based on someone that posted a lenghty DD and got 5 upvotes. My highest moment was saying ""brb"" in a meeting at work to throw 20k into a stock that was about to ""go to the moon"" and in 2 minutes sell it for a 5k gain. I made 5k$ in 2 minutes while in a meeting at work. You know I couldn't give a fuck about that meeting anymore.

While all this happened my mental health was suffering. I didn't sleep because of the obsession, all I wanted to talk with people were stocks (so they naturally talked less with me). I lost the value of money. Talking about prices of an Airbnb with my mom and I said this one costs 100$/night but it has a jacuzzi her face dropped. She was like ""100$ per night? Are you insane? that's A LOT"" (remember, minimum wage is 300$/month). In my mind that was like nothing. I made 5k in 2 minutes. What is 100$ even gonna cost?

I was already dreaming that in 1 year I'm buying a lambo. My performance at work dropped, my relationships suffered and I was stressed 90% of the time. Some days where I would make money I'd still be pissed because I could have made more. It was NEVER ENOUGH.

January 2021: 18k -&gt; 40k.

**February 2021 (first half)**

February started the same. I got up to 50k in the first week since everything was so easy. Just read all the subs and figure out what to buy. I made bank on CClV and whenever I sold something, I couldn't just let my money sit. I'd have to buy something again. ""Hey look I made 1k today. Maybe let the money sit, since there's nothing more to be bought"". Fuck that, buy random tickers that are already up 300% the last 5 days. What could go wrong?

February 2021 (first half): 40k -&gt; 50k.

**February 2021 (second half)**

We all know what happened here. The stock market crashed hard. Pennystocks, S -P -A -Cs and all speculative stocks dropped like 30-50% in this period. My portofolio went from 50k to 40k. 10k Loss in half a month. That was a wake up call. I had days when I would lose what is my monthly salary and didn't even flinch. I knew I was in deep trouble and that I need to stop. Talked with people and forced myself to delete the app. Hardest moment of the year.

February 2020 (second half): 50k -&gt; 40k.

**March 2020**

I took a one month break. It was hell. I would still check the subs daily and see mostly bad posts like ""everything is crashing, we are all gonna go bankrupt"". I was smiling cus I was not in it now. But still, even in this sea of red, some stocks would still do 100-200% in a day. Mainly biopharma pennys. So whenever I'd see someone making bank I would feel the urge again. But I said I will stop and I did. I would start looking less and less at the subs. From checking it 10 times a day to once a day. To checking it every other day. In the last week of march I didn't bother reading anything anymore. I was not making money, but I felt FREE. It was such a relief to sleep more than 3 hours a night, not feel constant stress and panic attacks due to the market. I was recovering from an addiction.

**April 2021 - present**

Since I couldn't let my money sit in my bank and do nothing, just lose value due to inflation I decided I should still invest, but in a safer approach. Took 5k out to spoil myself with a new bike, a 2 week trip this summer and left some as an emergency.

The rest of the money, 5k I invested in some space S -P -A -Cs that I will hold long term. The rest (30k) I placed in VUSA (Vanguard version of S&amp;P 500). Now when the ETF drops 1% a day I'm not even moved. The volatility is still high in these markets but it's nothing compared to what it was before.

I shared my story in hopes that other people can relate to this, or learn something from my experience with pennystocks, gambling, addiction and mental health.",1620896673,"How I turned 10k into 50k with mainly pennystocks/meme stocks, what did it cost and why I decided to move to an ETFI decided to make this post since this community basically changed my life in the last 6 months.

**What this money means to me**

For context of this post, I'm not from USA, I live in a country where minimum wage is 300$/month and the average wage is around 700$/month. So 50k is A LOT of money here. I work in SWE so I already earn around top 5% in my country, but not even close to what SWEs in America earn.

**August 2019**

I started trading in August 2019 with 500$ in my broker. I was buying the most vanilla stocks I could (KO, AAPL, MSFT, DIS) and got hooked once when my portofolio was up 10% at some point and I sold everything, banking 50$. I went out to a restaurant and basically payed it all with money I made ""tapping some buttons on my phone"". To me, that was game changing. It was like gambling, but with way less risk. Like, What are the chances that those 4 companies would disappear and I would lose all my money overnight? Basically 0.

Fast forward to 2020. I was adding money monthly to my account and traded vanilla stocks for little profit. I was reading /r/wallstreetbets daily but didn't bother gambling all my money on meme stocks. Untill I decided to give it a try and bought RCL based on some DDs that it will recover during summer and ships will start sailing again. I placed all my money in this stock and held for a week. It went up ~30% and I made 2k dollars. I made more than my monthly salary by, again, ""tapping buttons on my phone"". This is when I knew I'd become a degenerate gambler.

**2019-2020**

Up until november 2020 I continued gambling with meme stocks from WSB while also adding money monthly. Gambled with SPCE, PLTR, PRPL and all the hot shit at that time. I was basically breaking even since I'd make 10% this week and lose 10% next week. My friend got into trading at this time. I had 10k in my account, he had 200$. So, since he had little money, he started dabbling with pennystocks.

December 2020: I was talking to my friend daily about penny stocks and he bought AIpine 4 technologies worth all his money and that 200$ in one month turned into 2k$. He made 1000% in one month. I've never heard of a stock moving 1000% in a month in my life before. Only meme coins would do that. So, being the degenerate I am, I moved to penny stocks.

**December 2020**

I had 10k$ to start with. I was reading this sub daily and throwing my money to random tickers that were mentioned every day. AßML was the first big money I made. I was reading the DD on this sub, crosschecking with other people on stocktwits/yahoo finance. Checking out myself the website etc (what everyone told you to do, not blindly follow random DDS) and in the end deciding to buy or not. I made 8k in December 2020. From 10k to 18k. 

**January 2021**

This was the month. The peak of my performance and decline of my mental health. I was less and less curious about checking if the DD is good or not. I was looking at an upvoted post, checking the top comment and throwing ~5k into that stock. I was reading this sub, the S -P -A -C -S subreddit, following dozen youtubers and was basically doing this 10-12 hrs a day. While at work, I'd check the premarket all day, refreshing every sub on new, looking at marketwatch and preparing my moves. It got to the point where I would not sleep at night because all I could think about were stocks. I was buying tickers that I didn't even know what the acronym standed for, based on someone that posted a lenghty DD and got 5 upvotes. My highest moment was saying ""brb"" in a meeting at work to throw 20k into a stock that was about to ""go to the moon"" and in 2 minutes sell it for a 5k gain. I made 5k$ in 2 minutes while in a meeting at work. You know I couldn't give a fuck about that meeting anymore.

While all this happened my mental health was suffering. I didn't sleep because of the obsession, all I wanted to talk with people were stocks (so they naturally talked less with me). I lost the value of money. Talking about prices of an Airbnb with my mom and I said this one costs 100$/night but it has a jacuzzi her face dropped. She was like ""100$ per night? Are you insane? that's A LOT"" (remember, minimum wage is 300$/month). In my mind that was like nothing. I made 5k in 2 minutes. What is 100$ even gonna cost?

I was already dreaming that in 1 year I'm buying a lambo. My performance at work dropped, my relationships suffered and I was stressed 90% of the time. Some days where I would make money I'd still be pissed because I could have made more. It was NEVER ENOUGH.

January 2021: 18k -&gt; 40k.

**February 2021 (first half)**

February started the same. I got up to 50k in the first week since everything was so easy. Just read all the subs and figure out what to buy. I made bank on CClV and whenever I sold something, I couldn't just let my money sit. I'd have to buy something again. ""Hey look I made 1k today. Maybe let the money sit, since there's nothing more to be bought"". Fuck that, buy random tickers that are already up 300% the last 5 days. What could go wrong?

February 2021 (first half): 40k -&gt; 50k.

**February 2021 (second half)**

We all know what happened here. The stock market crashed hard. Pennystocks, S -P -A -Cs and all speculative stocks dropped like 30-50% in this period. My portofolio went from 50k to 40k. 10k Loss in half a month. That was a wake up call. I had days when I would lose what is my monthly salary and didn't even flinch. I knew I was in deep trouble and that I need to stop. Talked with people and forced myself to delete the app. Hardest moment of the year.

February 2020 (second half): 50k -&gt; 40k.

stocks,Would it make sense to buy SQQQ now while the market is hot and flip it into TQQQ after a crash?,"I’m just thinking about it. Everyone says we’re in an all time raging bull market. It’s great. Everyone’s making money.

I’m thinking of throwing a few grand into SQQQ and just leaving it there and forgetting about it.

Eventually the market has to crash, right? Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this month or maybe not this year. But eventually.

Based on looking at how it performed in previous crashes it would definitely end up sitting lower than it is today if there is a serious crash.

I’d think it would probably result in some losses in the immediate future. But if I just put the money in and left it there, essentially considered it forgotten and never touched it...

Basically I would think of it as an insurance payment. If the market does crash and it effects my stocks then the losses would be balanced out by SQQQ gains.

In a minor crash like the COVID crash from March last year it would be like a 9 bagger. In the event of a major crash it would be a 100 bagger.

So if I put in for example 5k right now and just left it alone the worst case scenario would be that I lose some of the 5k. I could even buy it slowly and keep buying it to keep a good dollar cost average.

But then if there’s another minor crash like last year that 5k would become 45k. If there’s a major crash (complete devastation)that 5k would become 500k.

Thinking one step further, if it became obvious that the crash was over, I could flip whatever gains into TQQQ and then slowly ride the wave back up.

I haven’t made a decision yet but I’m having the overall feeling it would be a good idea.

However I’ve only been investing for a few months so there’s also a chance that I’m wrong about this and potentially overlooking some factor. It seems like it’s almost too good of an idea.

I would like to know everyones thoughts on this, please.",1620892801,"Would it make sense to buy SQQQ now while the market is hot and flip it into TQQQ after a crash?I’m just thinking about it. Everyone says we’re in an all time raging bull market. It’s great. Everyone’s making money.

stocks,Mat Ishbia called out in Feb Q4 earnings that he wanted to payback shareholders. May Q1 he delivered on the regular div and buyback.,"I have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1 earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while competitors are lagged.

During   the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on   the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:

The    Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid   on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And    so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet  is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and   we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change    the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,    those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

May Q1 Earnings Quote:

As    you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of     $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a     record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded     share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward  shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share  buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

Then in answering a question from an analyst

Doug   Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you   mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about   kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?   And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal   teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy   and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the   float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we    have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm     going to take advantage of that opportunity while being conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:    UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to    shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a    buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they    can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that  it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage. At current    stock price levels the CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded     share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward  shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share  buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

Then in answering a question from an analyst

Doug   Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you   mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about   kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?   And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal   teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy   and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the   float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we    have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm     going to take advantage of that opportunity while being conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:    UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to    shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a    buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they    can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that  it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage. At current    stock price levels the CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 23K shares of UWMC",3611,132,3479

These chips power our electronics, many of which are now being used in vehicles. In short, some of the auto industry plants are shutting down bc there aren't enough chips to continue building the cars. so, in my line of thinking some of the auto industry stocks' are going to fall bc they are losing money. This is also making the price of cars soar and people on a budget will probably just wait it out to buy since this is supposed to be over by 2022. So the auto industry is losing money in more than one way. For instance, Honda is already undervalued but if this chip shortage continues the stock could fall further and become very undervalued.

stocks,Tesla has a change in payment methods,"Elon has just stated they will no longer allow a certain coin for payment.

https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?s=21

This is a big change due to Elon's influence in that sector and TSLA's profitability with that coin. 

I am wondering if going forward we will see it completely gone for their balance sheet. 

In my opinion, it is hard to tell whether or not he was forced to say that, as the board has had past issues with Elon in the past. Either way, going forward this might change the public perception of Elon or Tesla, which will mostly likely have direct effect on the share price. 

I wanted to add I have no position in TSLA and wanted to provide an update. 

I thought this was especially interesting because that sector used Elon as excuse for a catalyst when TSLA invested into that coin. This obviously helped his public image as well. 

The fact that he also stated he's looking at other currencies is letting another crowd to think there may be a chance. I don't think the board would let him accept payment in that currency.

stocks,Rigel Pharmaceuticals,"Rigel Pharmaceuticals is a relatively small biopharmaceutical company that has had many positive developments in the last year; everything from stumbling upon the key to stopping the hyper-inflammatory Covid-19 disease state in its tracks, to recently having one of its drugs validated as a strong potential cancer therapeutic, to entering into a substantial co-development deal with one of the largest pharma's in the world Eli Lilly. Rigel has 3 drug programs it's actively working on including Fostamatinib, IRAK1/4 and RIP1 that are all in various stages of development. Below I'll be addressing these programs, some financial data, and price targets.

**Fostamatinib in ITP and WAIHA:**

Fost has been FDA/EMA/Canada approved for the treatment of ITP; an auto immune disorder that destroys blood platelets. Net sales in 2020 were $61m and RIGL expects those sales to grow in 2021. Israel approval expected Q2 or Q3 of 2021. Japan ph3 also just completed enrollment so approval is potentially on the horizon there as well.

Fost is in a late stage 3 study for WAIHA; an auto-immune disorder that destroys red blood cells. Expected enrollment completion late Q3 2021. There are no other approved treatments for this disease and RIGL had strong ph2 results. It is orphan designated which will also amount to a quicker review by the FDA.

**Fostamatinib for Covid:**

Fost was found by the University of Amsterdam to prevent Covid-19 cytokine storm by actively inhibiting spike proteins which are believed to lead to an over-active immune response that especially compromises the lungs. Further, it was found by Harvard and MIT to be the only FDA approved drug (in their 3700 drug database) to inhibit Mucin-1 which is elevated in Covid-19 as well as other non-Covid indications such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonias. When this research was brought to RIGL they took it to the National Institute of Health and the Imperial College of London who found it compelling enough to begin two separate investigator sponsored trials (1 completed) in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. At the NIH as well they conducted a study by which a process called NETosis was occurring in these patients. Little is really known about NETosis or how it effects various covid and non-covid disease states but it's suspected of leading to and causing systemic thrombosis. (NETosis is when neutrophils are spliced and release their extra-cellular DNA into the blood serum which then binds to available proteins to form a fibrotic net-like structure to stop pathogens) At the NIH in their study when they applied neutrophils to non-covid and non-severe covid patient blood serum only a few neutrophils activated but when they applied neutrophils to severe-covid blood serum the entire dish turned green indicating something in that serum was activating every neutrophil. In a follow up study they then applied fostamatinib to this serum and entirely prevented the neutrophil destruction and DNA release from occurring. Additionally multiple other studies have also helped shed light on fostamatinib's role in preventing Covid platelet aggregation and thrombosis. Further the Department of Defense is paying for the lion's share of Rigel's phase 3 Covid study which may potentially lead to a substantial purchase by the DoD as indicated in the contract. See below.

NIH Phase 2 Results using Fostamatinib in ICU Covid-19 patients. 0 deaths, reduced ICU stay by 4 days (from 7 to 3), reduced adverse events by 50%, pulled fully ventilated patients off vent within 7 days, all biomarkers favored Fost over SoC. EUA being pursued.

**RIP1k program:**

Eli Lilly is co-developing RIGL's RIP1 program. RIGL received $125m upfront payment from Lilly this April, along w/ $835m in potential milestone payments, and royalties ranging from single digits to near 20% based on RIGL's involvement. Phase 2 studies expected to be launched this year. RIP1 is indicated in large CNS indications which Eli Lilly specializes that a relatively small pharma like RIGL can't undertake alone without substantial funding.

**IRAK1/4 program:**

RIGL has completed phase 1 studies and preparations are being made to begin phase 2 studies this year. Today RIGL saw a spike in price share due to data released by another company (Curis) where in a small cancer study of 9 patients all improved and at least 1 achieved complete remission status. It's expected the data readout will validate other IRAK inhibitors such as RIGL's IRAK1/4. Multiple other studies have found a number of indications in both Irak1 and Irak4 that RIGL may pursue.

**Outlicensed (partner-sponsored) trials**

Rigel has an extensive drug discovery program and has out-licensed a number of drugs that are currently in development. Rigel is entitled to substantial milestone payments and future stepped royalties (ranging from 5%-10% of net sales). RIGL often nets $20-40m annually from these agreements.

**Price Targets, institutional ownership and market cap**

H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis has a price target of $11.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Kristen Kluska price target of $7.

BMO Capital analyst Do Kim has a price target of $9.

Rigel is currently valued at \~$3.60 or about $600m.

Rigel has a high institutional ownership of 85%.

2. I was missing an entire day's worth of SPX last week. 
3. Afterhours/postmarket values don't match anyone else I've contacted that has tradingview. I've also referenced other chart/value websites and mine still differs.

stocks,How bad do we realistically expect this dip to continue?,"I have a lot of tech stocks (please no lectures on diversify. I know. But I can't diversify when my holdings are thousands in the hole).

Anyway, my biggest holding (dkng) has gone down virtually 10 straight trading days. 1 of those were green but by 13 cents so not much of a gain there.

The problem is, I've been using margin to average down because I honestly did not expect it to get this low. I'm now pushing margin limits and need some expert advice. What to cut.

My biggest bag holders in order are...

DKNG (-23% down, $54.89 CPS)
PLTR (-19% down, $23.11 CPS) 
SFT (-15% down, $9.16 CPS) 
PINS (-13% down, $65.95 CPS)

DKNG is 55% holding, PINS is 22%, PLTR 8%, SFT 5%

Needless to say, DKNG is the problem. I'm holding a lot and it's down the most. I used to believe in the stock, but now I don't know what do believe.

So my question is...

Do I just cut the cord and drop dkng before it drops to $20-25. Do I cut PINS? I can get rid of PLTR AND SFT but that won't help my margin deficit much.

Or do I continue what I've been doing and shaving 10 shares at a time off either dkng or pins when margin gets close to max and just hope this crash stops soon?

Serious suggestions please. No lectures. I know my mistakes. I just need to figure out the best way to mitigate my losses.

Note - I don't need this money right now. I have another non-margin account that I never look at because I have all the time in the world for the stocks to rebound.

stocks,Royal Helium - $RHC.V discovered a large amount of helium under 2 wells and are one step away from production on their third well!!!,"Royal Helium - $RHC.V discovered a large amount of helium under 2 wells and are one step away from production on their third well!!!

Today it was finally confirmed. 

A quote directly from Royal Helium’s CEO 

“Andrew Davidson, President and CEO of Royal states, ""we are exceptionally pleased with this discovery at Climax. The Regolith appears to be helium charged over a significant interval and, once the production methodology is determined, it has the potential to be one of the largest helium discoveries in Saskatchewan history.”

Royal Helium - RHC.V one step away from production 

“Production planning will commence shortly on Climax-1, with the intent of producing and monetizing the helium, CO2, and nitrogen gas streams. Discussions with potential processing partners are underway and Royal will report once a gas processing agreement and off-take agreement(s) are in place.”

*A drilled helium well, once all the testing is complete, can start producing almost immediately. 

Royal helium plans on using a membrane system in order to filter the various gases from the well. Helium, being the smallest molecule, will be the gas left over in the end. The system is relatively small, about the size of a C-can, and the gas can be loaded directly from the wellhead.

Basically, Royal helium intends to use a transport truck which will carry a number of large cylinders. They intend to fill the cylinders at the wellhead and then transport them to a plant in Montana. The drive will take approximately 4-6 hours. Also, NA helium has a processing plant right next door.

Another method of generating revenue will be for outside companies to bring in their own equipment and purchase their helium directly from the wellhead.

This will also open the door for other Dynamic revenue sources, but at the time of this writing, I was not able to find more details.

The revenues generated from these first 3 wells will be used to finance the drilling operations on further wells, hence creating more revenue and starting a snowball effect. Royal helium estimates that it will take 6 months for a well to recover its cost of drilling and testing followed by 9.5 years of profit per well.*

The train is about to leave the station to the rocket pad. $RHC.V, at 56c a share, is a steal and it won’t last long.

There is now a tremendous amount of upside and very little risk.

stocks,Inflation explained like you're five,"I started that as a comment but it became quite lengthy and I decided that it should be a separate post instead.

Let's say, currently the inflation is 0%, a burger costs $1 and a single stock  share of any company costs $20. You can buy 20 burgers if you sell that share.

Tomorrow the inflation becomes 10%. Everything is more expensive by 10%. The burger now costs $1.1, the share costs $22. You can still buy 20 burgers for that share. But if you have sold that share yesterday at $20, today you can buy only 18 burgers. Your money lost buying power due to inflation. That's why some people say that during the inflation it's better to have money in the market, you protect your money from losing value by buying stocks. But it's often not that simple, we'll return to this at the end.

The government doesn't like 10% inflation, it's too high. They like 5% inflation. To achieve that they need to decrease the demand for buying burgers. When less people compete for the goods, the price of those goods decreases. How can government decrease the demand? They do it by increasing the interest rate in banks. Now instead of spending $1.1 on the burger you can put that money into the bank, and over time your money will grow in value, and in 30 years you'll be able to buy 1000 burgers. Not everyone is capable of delayed gratification, so only part of people will put money into the bank, the others will continue buying burgers. Anyway, the demand decreases and eventually the burger price decreases to $1.05, that's 5% inflation, exactly what the government wants.

Now let's talk about the banks. How do they earn money? They do it by offering loans. Let's say, a fancy tech company wants to build SkyNet. They need to hire developers and they need money to pay those developers. The company does not earn anything yet, so the plan is to get money from the bank, build the product, then start earning and then repay the debts. Bank gives the money to that company and asks to return the same amount and 10% extra later. Where did bank get that money? Well, most likely they are just holding your salary on your bank account. Your money is safe, no one can steal it, and at the same time bank can use that money to give loans and earn interest. Everyone is happy.

You remember that the government increased the interest rate to fight the inflation, right? Previously your money was just sitting at the deposit and doing nothing. But now you started to earn some interest on it. Let's say, it's 5% per year. This makes banks sad, because instead of just using your money and getting extra 10% from the SkyNet company, they now also need to pay you those 5%. Obviously they won't pay it out of their own pockets. They will instead ask the SkyNet company to return not 10%, but 15% at the end of the loan period.

The SkyNet company now has to pay more to the banks. It's difficult as they have no earnings yet. Where do they take the money to pay banks? They have to issue more shares and sell it to investors. More shares means more supply. More supply means that the price of the good drops, so the shares of that company become much cheaper.

So, if you're sure that inflation is inevitable, how can you prepare for this? We discussed that a bit at the beginning. One option is to keep money in your account. Your $20 will lose some value, you'll be able to buy only 18 burgers instead of 20. Another option is to buy a share of the SkyNet company. As we've just discussed, it will likely drop in value and will cost like $12, you'll buy only 11 burgers for it. But who knows, maybe in 5 years it'll pay of. And a yet another options is to buy a share of the burger company. Since burgers became more expansive the company also earns more and its share is more valuable. Most likely it costs $25 now, and you can buy more burgers with it.

You've already figured it out. The burger company is what we call a value stock. The SkyNet company is the growth stock. And since everyone expects inflation, we currently observe the rotation from the growth stocks into the value stocks.",1620854657,"Inflation explained like you're fiveI started that as a comment but it became quite lengthy and I decided that it should be a separate post instead.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 12, 2021","PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 12, 2021

The selloff in stocks intensified after a report that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose at a faster-than-expected pace, spooking market participants about the prospects of inflationary pressures, increasing pressure on equities. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 2.09% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 2.54%, while the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell 2%, the worst slump since February.

The Bureau of Labor statistics reported that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. This confirms fears market participants have had for months. Tomorrow, the producer price index will be released, which is expected to show a similar spike like the CPI. 

Market participants are worried that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, the surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices, which, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they weren’t unexpected and with the SPY trading near record levels for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of some technology, this week’s sell-off is not unexpected. In my opinion, the current fear around the equity market seems overblown, and though I expect volatility going forward, my long-term outlook remains bullish and will be looking to take advantage of this dip in the indexes and mega-caps. 

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown.

The selloff in stocks intensified after a report that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose at a faster-than-expected pace, spooking market participants about the prospects of inflationary pressures, increasing pressure on equities. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 2.09% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 2.54%, while the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell 2%, the worst slump since February.

The Bureau of Labor statistics reported that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%.

**- What stocks, outside of gas companies, oil rigs, and anything that produces/distributes oil, is heavily reliant on oil?**

stocks,The latest CPI numbers can be explained by the Semiconductor and Lumber Shortage,"A lot of you have looked at the numbers, but how many of you have actually looked INTO the numbers? I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Shit hasn't changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#**The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

On August 6, 2004, it changed its name from Boulder Acquisitions, Inc. to China Digital Wireless, Inc., marketing in pager and mobile phone distribution until May 10, 2007, when the company completely ceased these businesses. In December 2006, the company extended its business to the energy saving and recycling industry. On March 8, 2007, it finally changed its name to current China Recycling Energy Corporation.

The company manufactures various energy-generation projects from the byproducts of industrial processes, such as blast furnace top gas recovery turbine (TRT) unit (using exhaust pressure and heat emitted from industrial processes), waste gas power generation (WGPG) systems, combined cycle power plant (CCPP) systems; biomass power generation systems (BMPG); and wate heat  power generation (WHPG) systems.

(Huaxin), and Xi’an TCH’s subsidiary Erdos TCH Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd (Erdos TCH)).

In October 2011, China Recycling Energy Corporation completed an acquisition of a 12-megawatt biomass power generation system from Shenqiu Yuneng Thermal Power Co., Ltd.

In June 2011, the system of the project ZhongBao was sold to and leased back from Cinda Financial Leasing Co., Ltd

As a future play, personally as I see resources drying up and coal and oil being phased out. The world is still not in a full position for the transition fully over to solar, wind and tidal technologies. Therefore technology such as biomass energy generation from the burning of recycled waste is a viable option which creates a use for waste accumulating on landfill sites and can help provide the transition from fossil fuels and provide energy for the installation of green infrastructure.

As a value play; $CREG is currently trading at a price to book ratio of 0.2 that states that this company has 5 times more cash on hand in assets than it is currently trading at on the stock market.

It has a current ratio of 2.67 which shows that it can pay its short term debts off 2.67 times over with current cash on hand.

The company currently has $92,000,000 worth of assets and if we looked at cash per a share this stock is at $24.59 it is currently trading at $7.90 as we speak so if you want to 3x in the next year this is a deep value play.",1620845131,"$CREG my value playI've been looking for a deep value play for a while and after reading the little book of value investing and applying practices covered within the book I came across this diamond.

In October 2011, China Recycling Energy Corporation completed an acquisition of a 12-megawatt biomass power generation system from Shenqiu Yuneng Thermal Power Co., Ltd.

In June 2011, the system of the project ZhongBao was sold to and leased back from Cinda Financial Leasing Co., Ltd

As a future play, personally as I see resources drying up and coal and oil being phased out. The world is still not in a full position for the transition fully over to solar, wind and tidal technologies. Therefore technology such as biomass energy generation from the burning of recycled waste is a viable option which creates a use for waste accumulating on landfill sites and can help provide the transition from fossil fuels and provide energy for the installation of green infrastructure.

As a value play; $CREG is currently trading at a price to book ratio of 0.2 that states that this company has 5 times more cash on hand in assets than it is currently trading at on the stock market.

It has a current ratio of 2.67 which shows that it can pay its short term debts off 2.67 times over with current cash on hand.

The company currently has $92,000,000 worth of assets and if we looked at cash per a share this stock is at $24.59 it is currently trading at $7.90 as we speak so if you want to 3x in the next year this is a deep value play.",2903,19,2884

stocks,Spotify Technology SA is dropping and I'm stuck,"Spotify's stock has been dropping a lot. It was rising in in the first parts of there year, hit it's all time high of 315€ and down we go. I have a couple of questions.

1. Why is this happening? All the news and graphs I have read indicate that Spotify should be rising and not dropping. They are making a lot of money now and people still use it. I just don't understand.
2. I know I should take my money out, that's a given, but what do I do after. Technically I could wait for it to drop more and buy the stocks back when it starts to show signs of rising. Or I could just go lick my wounds and invest my, now much smaller, amount of money in some other stocks. This is what I think is the most reasonable thing to do.
3. I could also sit on the stock and just sell it back when it rises again but there's no indication if the stock will ever even do that.

I've been playing the options game for about 6 months now and made a tidy profit but now I'm looking towards dividends for one reason. To help my mom retire. My mom has no money saved and no assets so she can't retire on her own so imma pay her back for raising me as a single mom lol. The thing I noticed was on the etf SPHD it says they pay monthly at a little over 4% so that comes out to .15 a share each month. If I'm reading this right if I buy 1400 shares at 45 a pop  or about 63k I should be able to set my mom up with an account that pays 70k a year pre tax or about 5000 pre tax. Am I right on this assessment or am I wrong? Cuz if this is the case I can set my mom up for the rest of her life.

Palantir Proves Solutions Are Resonating, Growth Ahead

We are raising our fair value estimate for the narrow-moat company.

We are raising our fair value estimate for narrow-moat Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to $25 from $24 after its first-quarter results left us more bullish about its long-term prospects. While we do not expect GAAP profitability for years, we believe Palantir is prudently investing in ramping up its business to land a wider breadth of organizations from various industries, sizes, and geographic locations. Palantir constitutes a minuscule amount of overall U.S. defense spending and has an embryonic commercial customer base; however, once Palantir’s solutions are installed, we believe organizations can become reliant on its products. With shares trading around $19 in intraday trading, we believe investors have upside to capture in this disruptor.

Palantir’s revenue growth of 49% year over year topped our already aggressive expectations, thanks to resounding results in the government vertical and strong broad-based expansion within the U.S. Government revenue was the bright spot, growing 76% year over year. U.S. government business grew by 83%, led by defense and pandemic-related use cases. We do not believe Palantir’s non-defense government segment will fizzle out after businesses reopen, as we think the company is proving its software capabilities during a time of crisis, which can open the door and lead to proliferation across other government entities working to harness their data.

Commercial sales rose 19% and were impacted by certain geography lockdowns, although U.S.-based commercial growth increased 72% year over year. With Palantir’s push to modularize its offerings and expand its sales reach, commercial opportunities within the U.S. and U.K. increased by 2.5 times and commercial pilots more than doubled since February. Alongside the strong top-line results and expectations of continued strength ahead, Palantir also posted 34% adjusted operating margin (up 200 basis points sequentially) and 44% adjusted free cash flow margin.",1620832581,"Morningstar upgrades Palantir to Buy with price-target of $25https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1039009/palantir-proves-solutions-are-resonating-growth-ahead

[Forget Tesla: Experts Say These 4 Tech Companies Are The Future Of Self-Driving Cars](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/best-autonomous-driving-companies)

&gt; WE WERE PROMISED SELF-DRIVING CARS before the end of the last decade, and those predictions are turning out to be wildly, hilariously wrong. But things may be catching up — and the loser of the pack, according to Sam Abuelsamid of Guidehouse Insights, is Tesla, which may surprise droves of Elon-stans.

And:

&gt; The report specifically calls out Argo’s testing on highways in Miami. “Highway driving capability will enable Argo-powered AVs to expand operating domains to more areas of the regions they serve,” says the report. It does note that Argo AI has not shown off its autonomous tech with public ride testing as Waymo has.

On the other hand, electric vehicle maker Volkswagen is embracing lidar for autonomous driving technology.

&gt; Volkswagen AG plans to offer a highly automated version of the hippie-era microbus it’s reviving as an electric van as the carmaker commercializes self-driving technology along with startup Argo AI.

VW is preparing an ID.Buzz with Level 4 autonomy -- meaning the vehicle can drive itself under certain conditions -- to be ready for commercial transport of people and goods for 2025. It’s testing Argo AI’s technology at six U.S. locations and will expand to a site in Munich this year to further refine the system.

And:

&gt; VW stepped up its efforts in the space when it invested in and teamed with Argo while broadening an alliance with Ford in 2019. Europe’s largest automaker put its van unit in charge of the collaboration, as it’s betting self-driving technology can be rolled out for commercial use in designated areas faster than with passenger cars on public roads.

The German automaker’s electric ID Buzz vans will use hardware and software developed by Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based startup that is backed by Ford and VW.

stocks,My take on 5N Plus VNP.TO Earnings Report for Q12021," A friend asked me to look into the company. I took about 15min going through the earnings report and management report.

This is what I thought.

5N’s core business is refined minerals, yet this past quarter they bought a biological life based pharmaceutical company (completely different company with no similarities), and announced their intention to buy a space solar cell producer (again a different company with no similarities).

They are also backlogged with production orders for their main business (refined minerals), but haven't managed to find a way to capitalize on the increased demand, and they’re buying unrelated companies.

For their outlook they reiterated their 25% growth y/y. The stock is down because its a semiconductor , growth, and pharmaceutical company (basically a Nasdaq-like growth stock), with a weird report (due to the announced acquisitions of unrelated companies with no synergies to exploit.

Their profit is low, a consistent 1 penny per share. They seem to be taking any extra profit and using it to buy back shares in the company (although this ended recently). This practice reduces available shares boosting the value of each share, but it also had an effect on the bottom line in this case. I think it can go cheaper (perhaps a sub $2.50 is a good entry point) because its more than double price from Sept 2020 ($1.76), and the strategy the CEO is running with these unrelated purchases will reduce confidence in the company in the short-term until it can be proven that management was able to integrate and show profit.

Here are the results.,"**Preamble:** The ability of Congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Congress members** **beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Congress trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (&lt;5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&amp;P500 returns during the same period. 

a.            One Month

b.            One Quarter

c.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns made by the Congress**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.55%|2.42%|0.12%|
|One Quarter|8.76%|7.42%|1.34%|
|Till Date|32.40%|26.40%|5.99%|

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

**Returns if you followed their trades (after the disclosure)**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.0%|2.48%|\-0.48%|
|One Quarter|10.46%|7.89%|2.57%|
|Till Date|29.62%|23.73%|5.89%|

If you had invested in the stocks Congress bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

stocks,Amazon Wins Fight to Throw Out $303 Million EU Tax Bill,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/amazon-inflicts-another-tax-defeat-on-eu-s-vestager

Now Apple beat a much bigger tax bill recently where it was $13 B it turned out was not owed to Ireland, and $303 M is a trifle for a company Amazon's size. It's less than 1% of their European gross income. But I think renewing Amazon's court room power means that there will be at least a brief spike for Amazon today as the word gets out. 

Notably it could establish beneficial precedent for Nike and Ikea who are having similar tax bill fights.

stocks,Softbank Earnings (3.3 P/E),"I was taking notes while I was listening but I can't type fast enough to transcribe everything. I'll skim through and post the highligts.

47 billion usd net income, including one-time gain from selling sprint etc.

200 to 236 billion usd increase in NAV (including debts) over 12 months

Breakdown of net asset value: 47% BABA, 25% SVF1+2, 32% other

269 billion usd equity value of holdings, 34 billion usd net debt, 12% loan to value (25% expected in normal times)

12 months ago they announced 2.5 trillion jpy on share repurchases, and 4.5 trillion jpy monetization strategy. Ended up doing 10 trillion jpy in monetizing [includes pending Arm deal], today 2.5 trillion jpy share buyback was completed, and will be retired from treasury.

2.7k jpy EPS in last year [TSE shares, not OTC], NAV is 15k jpy/share, 9.3k jpy/share [actual price]; 3.3 P/E, so it's still undervalued on paper.

1 year ago SVF -1.116 billion jpy quarterly loss, last quarter 3.590 billion jpy quarterly income from svf. Last 12 months 6.358 trillion jpy gain from SVF.

Of the companies that have gone public from the portfolios; SVF1 originally invested 15.7 billion usd, not worth 60.4; SVF2 invested 1.6 billion usd, now worth 6.2 billion.

SVF1: 60% of gain in value went to Softbank Group, because 40% of equity is outside investors with preferred shares and fixed return. SBG had 39% return on net equity annualized (IRR). SVF2: was all SBG capital, 30 billion usd used, 119% IRR. Latam Fund: 2.6 billion usd invested, now 4.0 billion fair value, net equity IRR 62%. 244 total investments across all 3 including deals pending closings.

Companies fluffed: Nvidia, Gopuff, Better, Jellysmack, Trax, Jobandtalent

Important notes from Q&amp;A:

No change in strategy with BABA, so probably mostly holding as Masa sees no fundamental changes in it as a business and it makes plenty of money. Notes that Mapbox deal with SVF unmentionable company is not announced yet (didn't comment on it specifically) but saw no problem with Softbank unmentionable companies merging with SVF portfolio companies. No expectation of doing more share buybacks, implies he would allow share price to fall further below book value of assets and focus on investing. Wants to focus on systemic approach to investing to exiting companies and create more regular pipeline so more steady revenue going forward. Says SVF2 money can be recycled easily and a 3rd party investor is not necessary, happy with amount of capital available. Downplays worries about risks of technology regulation, says he is focused on unicorns not megacaps.

My take: fundamentals are good. Investors are not going to like that he no longer plans to commit to share buybacks. I'd expect the share price to fall a fair bit medium term. Masa implied high levels of confidence on BABA and Arm deal to NVDA which are the 2 big question marks right now.",1620812141,"Softbank Earnings (3.3 P/E)I was taking notes while I was listening but I can't type fast enough to transcribe everything.

I live in Poland. Let's take a look at one of the local companies traded on Warsaw's stock exchange: [https://imgur.com/a/74npreU](https://imgur.com/a/74npreU). I find it hilarious that while the stocks of huge sophisticated tech companies are dropping, the stocks of a local producer of smoked sausages (everyone loves them!) has risen +125% since the beginning of the year. It beats S&amp;P500 and all giant companies, it has reasonable P/E, it's well defended against the inevitable inflation - when the food price rises the earnings of this company should also rise. It looks like a great opportunity to hedge against the current market conditions. I'm also pretty sure that every other country has some local equivalent gem. Do I miss anything?

I understand that long term investments mean that you shouldn't be too worried about market dips.
 
since Im probably going to be in for around 7 years I'm afraid the crash will affect me more since I don't have too much time to let the market recover but at the same time Might be waiting too long for a crash that wouldn't happen and miss the bull run gains.

I'm relatively new to the stock scene but have been studying the market for a few months, what do you think is the best option for me to invest in right now?

stocks,Auto stocks seem to be riding too high on the EV hype,"I feel like Tesla sunk it's teeth into a niche market of luxury electric cars that appear futury. But the allure of having a Tesla in my opinion is that they are different and unique, not necessarily that they are electric. They are like the Macbooks of cars.

Now I get creating an affordable electric car, and marketing it as a cost saver in gas and maintenance, but I believe trying to compete with Tesla in their little market of cyberpunk LARPERs is suicide. As an example... Ford just announced an electric f-150. As far as I know, there are two kinds of people who own f-150's: 

1) Blue collar workers who's only consideration in buying a truck is that it does the job for as cheaply as possible, they could care less if it's with a gas or electric truck.

2) People who want to compensate for their fragile masculinity by driving the biggest, most noisy, gas guzzling, obnoxious atmosphere killing vehicle they can get their hands on. In which case, electric might be a negative if anything. 

GM seems to be throwing all of their eggs into the electric vehicle hype. They are planning on transition all their vehicles to electric by 2035.

Now, one thing I understand about the auto industry is that it's a nightmare of a business to be in and the margins are terrifyingly slim. Macro economic variables can still punish them severely even if they do everything right. If they make a mistake? Like overestimating the market for expensive electric vehicles and spending a fortune on creating the capabilities to manufacture them? I mean it's not even really outside the realm of possibilities that they go bankrupt over something like that. 

I'm not bearish on auto companies, I just don't see anyone talking about the risk, they seem to jump every time they announce an EV. EV's have a lot of potential, but I don't see a huge demand for them. The vast majority of people, as you can see by how tightly car sales correlate with macroeconomic trends, seem to just think of cost when they buy a car, they just buy whatever is the best deal they can find. The rest who buy luxury vehicles seem to think of them as a fashion statement. I don't think either care about fuel source.",1620778036,"Auto stocks seem to be riding too high on the EV hypeI feel like Tesla sunk it's teeth into a niche market of luxury electric cars that appear futury.

Now, one thing I understand about the auto industry is that it's a nightmare of a business to be in and the margins are terrifyingly slim. Macro economic variables can still punish them severely even if they do everything right. If they make a mistake? Like overestimating the market for expensive electric vehicles and spending a fortune on creating the capabilities to manufacture them? I mean it's not even really outside the realm of possibilities that they go bankrupt over something like that. 

I'm not bearish on auto companies, I just don't see anyone talking about the risk, they seem to jump every time they announce an EV. EV's have a lot of potential, but I don't see a huge demand for them. The vast majority of people, as you can see by how tightly car sales correlate with macroeconomic trends, seem to just think of cost when they buy a car, they just buy whatever is the best deal they can find. The rest who buy luxury vehicles seem to think of them as a fashion statement. I don't think either care about fuel source.",2240,53,2187

NOBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS! Now more than ever.

That being said, I get a bit annoyed with the ""I told you so and everyone should have known"" responses. It's easy to boast when you are right and in reality you could have just as easily been wrong.

It doesn't seem like a big deal until someone who lost a lot of money feels singled out like they are the only one who didn't see it coming. No this isn't about me but more what I witnessed in 2009. 

If a year from now the S&amp;P is down 20% from where we are today we can justify it. If it is up 20% we can justify it. Doesn't mean we know anything today.

stocks,What are the costs associated with day trading options?,"
I’ve been day trading Tesla options for the past few weeks and have been getting decent at scalping profits. 50-100 bucks per trade sometimes I lose obviously but always mitigate my downside with a mental stop loss.

I know there are fees associating with buying an option. But are there other hidden costs? 

I saw that I day traded almost 2 million dollars this year worth of options which is well over my account value. 

I don’t want to accidentally have some huge number to deal with on my taxes or something. I filed for mtm to avoid the wash rule but I just want to make sure there’s nothing out there that can f me up?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 11, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 11, 2021**

Bottom line, the extreme volatility in the market, particularly in tech stocks, continued today, with tech stocks opening deep in the red before recovering throughout the day, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going from roughly 2% down at open to close to break-even by close. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears of inflationary pressures causing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected are affecting the market to the downside while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters the Fed’s argument that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the producer price index (PPI), set to be released on Thursday. These reports will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens. 

Last Friday, the April Job Report showed only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below February 2020. For months, members of the Federal Reserve, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have consistently said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory” and want to see progress rather than projections in the labor market before they consider tightening monetary policy.  In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Put simply, Powell is saying that after the severe decline of prices following the quarantine in March, a rise in inflation as the economy recovers is not surprising and reflects transitory factors (transitory meaning not permanent).

On the other hand, market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. Market participants are anxiously waiting for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the Producers Price Index (PPI), which are both expected to show a significant jump. Expectations for CPI are 3.6% year-on-year for the headline print and 2.3% year-on-year for the Core Inflation Rate (Core inflation rate is the one most people think about when talking about inflation). PPI is expected to be 5.9% year-on-year for April. If the numbers come out much higher than predicted, some analysts wonder if the Fed will realistically be able to hold out on raising rates for the foreseeable future. 

In short, the sharp deceleration in job growth shown in the April report serves to allay concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten rate anytime soon, which may be why tech was able to bounce back somewhat today. For months, Jerome Powell and other members have reiterated they want to see significant progress in the labor market before they consider tightening policy and will telegraph their intentions well in advance. On the other hand, if the CPI and PPI numbers come in way higher than consensus estimates, inflation may begin to become a real concern for the Federal Reserve. 

**Highlights**

* [Prices for single-family homes in the U.S. surged by the most on record](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-home-prices-surge-most-141744748.html) in the first three months of the year, with tight inventory levels and a jump in demand generating a rise in prices. Prices rose 16.2% year-over-year to reach a record high of $319,200, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.
* L Brands (LB) said it is spinning off Victoria's Secret. The move will result in the lingerie chain operating as its own publicly traded company
* Lara Mendona, who led the design of Bumble’s dating app (BMBL) is set to join Twitter (TWTR) as a senior manager of product design.
* Tesla Inc has halted plans to buy land to expand its Shanghai plant and make it a global export hub due to uncertainty created by tensions between the US and China, people familiar to the matter told Reuters.
* Boeing (BA) reported 737 MAX jet deliveries fell to just four airplanes in April from 19 the previous month, as the best-selling aircraft struggles with an electrical problem that has re-grounded part of the fleet. The planemaker started delivering the 737 MAX to airlines in December nearly two years after the jet returned to service following a lengthy safety ban, following two high profile accidents.
* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans to hold a May 20 meeting with senior U.S. auto industry leaders and other industry officials regarding the semiconductor shortage that has resulted in production cuts, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.
* No price target raises again due to technical issues on our end, will be resolved soon.

stocks,Nautilus Inc: Exposure to Connected Fitness at 7x earnings,"Nautilus is a leading global producer of home fitness equipment known for its Bowflex and Schwinn brands of connected fitness bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, and strength training equipment. The company is the 3rd largest player (by a large margin) in the fragmented connected fitness industry. The business, led by a new CEO, has executed on a transformational turnaround in its business model. It has shifted away from being a cyclical fitness equipment maker and towards becoming a high margin, subscription-oriented connected fitness company. The redesigned products have been selling extremely well, and the connected fitness subscription numbers are growing at triple digits (albeit from a small base). 

The company is valued at less than 1x sales, 7x earnings, and has 20% of its market cap in net cash on the balance sheet. The stock trades at over a 75% discount compared to public and private peers including Peloton, NordicTrack, Tonal, Tempo, and more.

Q1 numbers reported yesterday afternoon.

Excellent numbers and forward guidance confirms my viewpoint that the company has transformed its business, and at-home fitness is not going anywhere.  


I am also hopeful that they can capitalize on the fact that their treadmills aren't killing children and injuring adults (referencing the mess Peloton has found itself in).

  
**Q1 2021 Financial Highlights:**  


* $206.1 million revenue (+121% YoY) 
   * \+143.3% YoY excluding divested Octane Fitness commercial business (sold last October)
   * Blew past Q1 guidance of $145 million to $165 million (+55% to 75% YoY)
   * highest quarterly sales in 35-year company history
* $30.4 million net income (vs. $2.2 million Q1 2020)  

* $0.93 earnings per share (vs. $0.07 EPS Q1 2020). beat estimates by over 100%
* $100 million net cash on balance sheet (vs. $500 million market cap)
* 6x to 8x P/E
* $179 million in order backlogs at the end of March

**Apr-June 2021 Quarter Forward Guidance**  


* \+40% to +50% YoY sales growth (+51% to +62% excluding Octane Fitness), \~$170 million in revenue
* 250,000 JRNY subscribers by March 2022
* $12 million to $14 million annual CAPEX with majority earmarked for JRNY subscription service 

Blowout quarter that was even stronger than Q4 2020, which I believe most people suspected would be peak earnings for many ""pandemic winners.""  


The business itself has continued to perform extremely well. The majority of market participants have been extremely skeptical as to whether Nautilus was a one-hit pandemic winner. In contrast, all of my research indicated that at-home fitness was here to permanently stay for a large part of the population. Nautilus had also permanently transformed their product portfolio and business model (JRNY connected fitness service) to capture this growth in the market.

  
Q2 2021 is the first true ""pandemic YoY comp"" to gauge how the business will perform in a more normal world. The fact that Nautilus has guided to 40% to 50% YoY growth (and even higher excluding divested commercial business) means the company's ability to grow in the post-pandemic world is becoming clearly evident. The order backlog of $179 million (at the end of a $206 million sales quarter) is also indicative of this.

  
Margins and profitability will definitely be pressured for the next 1 to 2 quarters due to higher commodity prices, global chip shortages, and increased marketing and investment in JRNY. However, I don't see a particularly difficult path for them to hit $2.50 to $3.00 in EPS this year, which means the stock currently trades at around 6x to 8x earnings. 

  
This is quite cheap, especially considering that net cash is 20% of market cap, and the company is in the process of complementing its equipment business with predictable, high margin software revenue from the JRNY connected fitness subscription.

  
I have been frustrated that the market was not giving this company much credit over the last 9 months. But as they keep executing quarters like this, there's no way the stock can stay down here in a single digit P/E.",1620752592,"Nautilus Inc: Exposure to Connected Fitness at 7x earningsNautilus is a leading global producer of home fitness equipment known for its Bowflex and Schwinn brands of connected fitness bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, and strength training equipment.

stocks,Is there a long term play for aluminum or can manufacturers?,"Most people are worried about the environment.  Once they get over the manufactured CO2 hysteria and realize how much damage plastic bottles are actually doing to the environment there will be a shift.  I haven't seen any viable biodegradable products that are feasible so I predict aluminum cans will make a comeback.  Eventually the related companies will stop being idiots and run marketing campaigns targeting plastic bottles and exposing microplastics showing up in most living things on the planet.

I do not know whether aluminum or canning companies will be the better play, but something to keep an eye on.

Article published on my brokerage app today:

 **Global Beverage Cans Market (2021 to 2026) - Portable Nature of Cans Makes Them More User-friendly Presenting Opportunities - ResearchAndMarkets.com12:03 PM ET 5/11/21 | BusinessWire**DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 2021--   
The ""Global Beverage Cans Market by Material Type (Aluminium, Steel, and PET), Beverage Type (Alcoholic Beverages, Non-Alcoholic Beverages, and Water), Structure (2-Piece and 3-Piece), &amp; Region (NA, APAC, EUR, SA, and RoW) - Forecast to 2026"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.  


The beverage cans market is estimated at USD 23.7 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6%, to reach USD 31.2 billion by 2026.  


Globalization and the free movement of products are increasing. Therefore, packaged material requires longer shelf life, along with monitoring food safety and quality based upon international standards.  


The recycling properties of raw materials such as aluminium and steel also help in providing sustainable packaging. These factors have helped in the growth of the beverage cans market.  


Aluminium is estimated to account for the largest share in 2021 for beverage cans based on the material type segment  


Aluminium is 100% recyclable and contains 35% of recycled content. The rise in demand for sustainability and awareness regarding the environment have been propelling the demand for aluminium cans as packaging options for beverages. Further, the aluminium body offers different graphic designs to grab greater customer attention. It can be moulded in an infinite number of shapes. It can tolerate temperatures ranging from 40 degrees Celsius to 350 degrees Celsius. Aluminium cans have a better carbon footprint than other packaging materials used in the food &amp; beverage industry.

Once they get over the manufactured CO2 hysteria and realize how much damage plastic bottles are actually doing to the environment there will be a shift.  I haven't seen any viable biodegradable products that are feasible so I predict aluminum cans will make a comeback.  Eventually the related companies will stop being idiots and run marketing campaigns targeting plastic bottles and exposing microplastics showing up in most living things on the planet.

I do not know whether aluminum or canning companies will be the better play, but something to keep an eye on.

 **Global Beverage Cans Market (2021 to 2026) - Portable Nature of Cans Makes Them More User-friendly Presenting Opportunities - ResearchAndMarkets.com12:03 PM ET 5/11/21 | BusinessWire**DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 2021--   
The ""Global Beverage Cans Market by Material Type (Aluminium, Steel, and PET), Beverage Type (Alcoholic Beverages, Non-Alcoholic Beverages, and Water), Structure (2-Piece and 3-Piece), &amp; Region (NA, APAC, EUR, SA, and RoW) - Forecast to 2026"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.  


The beverage cans market is estimated at USD 23.7 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6%, to reach USD 31.2 billion by 2026.  


Globalization and the free movement of products are increasing. Therefore, packaged material requires longer shelf life, along with monitoring food safety and quality based upon international standards.  


The recycling properties of raw materials such as aluminium and steel also help in providing sustainable packaging. These factors have helped in the growth of the beverage cans market.  


Aluminium is estimated to account for the largest share in 2021 for beverage cans based on the material type segment  


Aluminium is 100% recyclable and contains 35% of recycled content. The rise in demand for sustainability and awareness regarding the environment have been propelling the demand for aluminium cans as packaging options for beverages. Further, the aluminium body offers different graphic designs to grab greater customer attention. It can be moulded in an infinite number of shapes. It can tolerate temperatures ranging from 40 degrees Celsius to 350 degrees Celsius. Aluminium cans have a better carbon footprint than other packaging materials used in the food &amp; beverage industry. These factors have significantly contributed to the growing use of aluminium cans in the beverage cans market.  


The non-alcoholic beverage category of the beverage type will hold the largest share in the beverage cans market along with growing at one of the fastest rate

People are worried this crazy inflation will not be transient, as insisted by the fed,  but instead will persist and force the fed to raise rates. But hasn’t the market already priced that in by now? Many many speculative/growth stocks have crashed over the past few months. High flyers like pltr, nio, QS, and arkk are 50-100% down from their recent highs. From my understanding cash flow 5 years out would be discounted by ~5% with a 1% increase in rates, but obviously we’re far past 5-10% drops. 

So then…

If interest rates really do start rising and Powell really does stop printing, how much worse can things get in the sectors that have already corrected? Is the raise in rates primarily going to affect the less speculative parts of the market if it comes? Growth companies are expected to trade at a premium to reflect some of their future earnings growth, are we still trading far above their fair value right now?

Am I missing something here, is there a lot more pain to come?",1620743382,"Are high interest rates already priced in?

stocks,Some Advice for Newer Investors from an Experienced Investor (5+Years),"Just thought I would drop a few suggestions in here as having invested for over 5 years I have found ways that have stopped me pulling my hair out during ""turbulent"" times such as these and hopefully can have some words of wisdom for newer investors:

1) Close the app, don't keep checking it every 5 mins or you will be impulsive and emotive in your choices as humans we tend to follow the sunken cost fallacy and often can't comprehend these losses are only on paper. 

2) Re-evaluate, if you are just trying to break even that is not good enough you need to have confidence this company's product will continue being good and if you sell now you are essentially saying I do not think the pricepoint will ever be greater than it currently is (although if you see another opportunity that you think have a better future make sure to consider this more deeply). I sold PLTR because I honestly don't think it will break $20 in the foreseeable future and bought it off hype, I took a loss but it gave me the liquidity to pivet elsewhere.

3) WWW - What went wrong, work out the weak points of your portfolio and what can you do better, for me I had gone over my risk tolerance in order to chase gains. I needed to pullback a sec and diversify into stocks like Tupper and Crocs which were undervalued and had low P/E's rather than sticking to tech and the ""hot stocks"". If you have knowledge of what went wrong you won't start getting unjustly angry because of not understanding the losses and just seeing your savings slip away. 

4) Remember that stock losses are temporary, I have had some dark days last few weeks but just getting outside and getting some fresh air has done me wonders, the whole market is down so don't beat yourself up over any mistakes, you only really need to worry if it is only your stocks dropping and there is no indication from the wider market. 

5) Always remember ""Mr Market"" [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mr-market.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mr-market.asp) he is irrational, he is crazy but he can be your best friend. Logically it can appear good earnings may mean a raise in Stock Price but the market is always forward looking, if they can't guarantee future earnings or guidance it will go down, there is always a twist to the logic.

6) This is more for the more experienced investors but:  don't gloat and mock the newer investors, they are at least trying to do something new - the current system really screws over us younger people and I tip my hat to anyone trying anything different. I can only speak for myself but the investing culture didn't run through my family so I'm entirely self taught and I made a lot of mistakes. Don't beat them while they are down remember: we all had to start at one point. 

Final PSA: The Stock Market is not for everyone, there is no shame in investing into an ETF or Bonds if life is in the way - I believe every investor has some element of fun when it comes to stocks in order to stay invested in the market. If it is never fun and is just an extra chore than it is probably not for you and you should have a more passive strategy.",1620739741,"Some Advice for Newer Investors from an Experienced Investor (5+Years)Just thought I would drop a few suggestions in here as having invested for over 5 years I have found ways that have stopped me pulling my hair out during ""turbulent"" times such as these and hopefully can have some words of wisdom for newer investors:

When i started, i  ""went in"" thinking i will only invest in things to ""hold forever"" or  atleast 5+ years (big, well known, companies that understand/use). Now, i  know it's full of posts like ""should i sell/should i buy, sell all now,  it's crashing"" etc. I would like to ask for your opinion guys on what  it's on my mind right now. I wanted to diversify my portfolio for a long  time now (too much on tech, ofc), and recently i started buying into  CSPX, so i get more diversification (equivalent tracker of s&amp;p500  VOO, as i'm in EU and can't buy VOO). Now, what i have in my mind right  now, seeing as everything in tech is ""slowly dying"", would it be wise to  sell only the ones that i have profit on (taking out ONLY the profit)  and put all of that into CSPX (DCA-ing over a couple of days/weeks), or  should i just hold everything for the long time. These are the positions  i have and the % of profits on them. GOOGL 30%, AMZN 6%, AAPL 14%, BO  13%, MA 14%, MSFT 5%, NVDA 18%, TSLA 14%, V 7%. The only ones that are  in red atm are NEE and DIS but not by much (&lt;5%), but i don't worry  about them at all, long term. So what's your opinion on that. Would it  be wise to only sell and take the profits out of those, and put that  into CSPX (thinking that it will do better overall during this ""tech  sellof""), sell only some of them, try buying the dip on some of these  big names (some prices look really good now imo), or just try to put  some new money into CSPX and don't touch the rest ? I'm just looking at  some points of views, as i'm new to this and i'm sure there are a lot of  more experienced people here. Also, something off-topic, also being on  my mind lately as i tried to think why is this selloff happening. Do you  think it has anything to do with all the ""coins"" hype atm ?

Stop picking stocks. Most likely, you don't know what you're doing. I know it feels great when a good pick goes high, the problem is that when a pick goes down you think ""it's coming up"", or ""can't go any lower"". It can. It does.

Stop that nonsense of ""a stock that a like"" and ""a price I'm comfortable with"", it's a variation of what I said above; basically a better-sounding way of throwing darts at a board, and that's because most of the time you don't know what you are doing.

If you know what you're doing, then definitely you don't know what the market will do. 

If you are going short term (say, less than a year) and you don't have an exit plan that you are ready to act upon, you're asking for trouble, The best exit plan is built out of GTC orders. You can't trust yourself when the market is going down 5% each day for a few days.

You don't need to look at your portfolio everyday if you are doing long-term. If not, be prepared for the psicological consequences of that constant worry. The time spent. The damage done around you (people change under stress). Is it worth it?

If you started recently, 2020 was not normal and seldom repeatable. Many have said this, but people love to have ""selective hearing"" when they are making money.

stocks,Any content creators that can be recommended by this sub?,"Hi there, I am looking for several YouTubers or Twitch users who provide in depth analysis of stocks, markets, companies and investing to help me pass time when working and educating me on the current economies. 

I current watch Joseph Carlson, because I think he provides rich insight into dividend growth but I have since caught up on all his videos. 

I am not fixed on dividend growth content creators, just anyone that can provide their own take on the market that's worth listening to and hopefully this post can also help people find these content creators to help further their knowledge on the market as well.

stocks,Write up a plan,"Recent posts here are mostly about questions regarding inflation, selloffs, uncertainty.

You can't be uncertain if you have a plan.

Most people that came to the stock market are without a plan and when some first idea doesn't work you pivot, you try different things losing even more money.

I've made a post bashing new investors for their lack of balls during red days so this is not it. This is a small guide to help you cope with emotions. 

Market is driven by 3 major factors.

1. Emotions - you can control them if you have a plan, altough you can't control what the market does. If there is a huge selloff and your strategy tells you to invest long term in for example utilites, treat yourself and buy the dip!
2.  Huge institutional investors. Well with our amount of money even if you are in the millions you and me - we are screwed. If they fart left and we go right well too bad, we need to wait for a change of wind direction.
3. Logical valuations. That is also within your area of competence. You can read 5-10 years worth of 10Ks and decide if a company suits your methods or not. 

That is if you are INVESTING.

There is a HUGE HUGE difference between investing, day trading, swing trading and trading options, investing for growth, investing for value or speculation.

You can't make money long term if you don't know into which group you belong. 

I for example am investing my money LONG TERM. Which means even if market dives I take my cash position and I deploy it to make more money in 2-3 years. I reinvest every single dividend for a snowball effect. 

I can't understand why people are joining a discussion without having any sort of fundamental information regarding investment strategy from the OP.

Yes we see you red lines, we see your winnings but tell us WHY and what for you are investing. For how long?

IMO every post should being with:

1. I am XYZ type of investor
2. My time frame is XYZ
3. My risk tolerance is low, average, high
4. I am using XYZ method of trading (swing trading, day trading, long term holding)

&amp;#x200B;

We can't have a decent sub without these type of infromation, right now this is a pit where people are dumping their thoughts like shit into toilet without any freaking context. 

&amp;#x200B;

So. 

The planning part. 

1. Ask yourself truly how much can you lose. 
2. Ask yourself why are you investing.
3. For how long
4. When to exit. For example if stock is 1-2-3 fold or maybe just after 30% uptick? Have that and then don't cry when you see drop from 178% gain to 13% because you never exited that position. I am for example holding dividend paying stocks, when one of them rises 50% I sell and I put that money into something else or I reinvest to the pie I have. 
5. How much can you really add? Are you going to DCA ( dollar cost average)? 
6. Throwing around HOLD THE DIP or JUST DCA won't work for people that in the market for a 3 year timeframe. I can hold a stock for 10 years without a flinch but most people can't. 
7. If you are uncertain use a paper account. Most of the notable platforms have a form of trading virtual money. Do it for a year and see if you are not bored already. It's about the process, a journey, if you are in for a short squeeze of time just play option like in a casino and then whine about losing or brag about winning. It's like giving a leash without a dog to a child to see if the child keeps walking out with the leash to make sure it can handle a dog long term. 
8. Make sure to be up to date but don't make decisions based on inflation or the interest rate if you are a long term holder. I know that inflation is a bad sing for day/swing traders because their positions and trading strategy will be harder so make sure to read up on that. I don't give a damn about those things, only when I buy. 
9. I buy once a year. I reinvest everything automatically to see the snowball but I make one big purchase a year. It gives me time, reliefs stress. I can read 100s of 10Ks before I hit that purchase button because of my investing plan I am stuck with it for minimum 5-10 years so it better be good. 
10. Decide if buying 10 stocks for 1000 dollars make sense. IMHO it doesn't. If you work with less then 10K just invest in 2-3 very well picked holding it will bring more money from divs and natural growth. If you purchase 15 holdings it doesn't make sense and you won't make a lot of money, you will be frustrated. 
11. If you can't invest more at a time work on yourself. Get an MBA, maybe do some certifications. Increase your wage. Don't enter the stock market to make it your main source of income without education. For me it is a hobby that will last a lifetime, for you it may be a chance to actually replace your ""normal"" job. So educate, go to local uni or a course (a good course, not a mentorship). Even if you are 40 and driving a forklift you can go to college and you can get new education. Your family should be supportive about you growing as a human being. 

&amp;#x200B;

It really doesn't matter for me what market will do in 3 hours from now, it may be the biggest drop we've ever seen and I don't care. I wait for a moment like that to deploy cash. If you hold options day trade well hats off to you for such a high risk tolerance and congrats on high rewards. 

Market is overheated, tech had a huge run but it doesn't mean that we will see a huge correction any time soon. Low rates are balooning the prices. Diversify a little to sleep better. Or not, just make sure you write it down and stick to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shares of the 3D printing company soared 14.5% in Monday's after-hours trading session. The market's positive reaction is largely attributable to adjusted earnings and revenue easily beating the Wall Street consensus estimates. The company's solid generation of cash from operations is also likely a factor.

Investors should know that Monday's after-hours reaction stems only from the first-quarter data, as 3D Systems didn't provide any guidance in its release.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1: All-in-1 quick DD for Apes who don’t have time for reeding or wrinkles for numbers. 

Reed’s Inc. ($REED) is beverage company that specializes in ginger beers and specialty sodas (Virgil’s brand). Sodas taste delicious, ginger beer is eh for me - but some people like it, and importantly it’s used in a bunch of mixed drinks (bars buy from them, bars reopening is good). Products are handcrafted, GMO free, and many have sugar-free and KETO friendly variants for the health crowd. And again - Virgil’s brand sodas are stupid level tasty.

So why have you never heard of them? Cuz competing with Pepsi and Coke products for shelf space is dummy difficult when you can’t offer the same obscene deals as mega-corporations like Pepsi and Coke. Long boring stuff cut out - that’s changing and people will have the opportunity to taste actually delicious soda and then there’s no going back.

It has been a short seller’s dream stock. With every piece of good news printed, shorts come in and tanks the price super low. But with what I suspect is a very good Q1 earnings report (and even if I’m wrong almost guaranteed fantastic Q2 earnings report), they’re not gonna be able to safely short it for some time. Basically, it’s the ‘ol buy and hodl again my Ape boys. As long as the shorts can’t tank the price after earnings - squeeze likely to happen shortly after. Apes that like numbers and stuff continue reading, otherwise, grab a few (currently way too cheap) shares and wait for tendies 👍

——————————————————————

2: Financials.

Just gonna be real with all you lovely Apes - Reed’s Inc. has yet to show its worth as a net profitable company. But, at least in my eyes, there’s a very good reason for that. The company went through a major restructuring right before Covid hit, and that restructuring has yet to be able to show its true benefits in a post pandemic world. Eh, more on that later - for now, I’ll just run you through the numbers.

Rather than copy-paste a ton of data into an excel sheet and pretend I gathered the data myself - here’s a link to the Yahoo! Finance financial sheets. I encourage cross-checking, but the numbers seem to hold accurate across the platforms I use.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/REED/financials?p=REED

There are a number of things I want to call attention to here, but they all have the same basics in common. We’ll use total revenue and gross profit as examples.

Total Revenue: From 2019 (TR: 33,820$) to 2020 (TR: 41,615), total revenue increased by more than 23%. (compare Coke: +3.7%; and Pespi: +4.8%;)

Gross Profit: From 2019 (GP: 7,876$) to 2020 (GP: 12,766$), gross profit increased by 62%. (Coke:+6%; Pepsi: +4.25%)

Take pretty much any numbers on their 2020 balance sheet, compare them to old numbers, then compare that % difference to their competitors. $REED is outperforming the growth of its sector by far. Good numbers going - despite the fact beverage sector as a whole had a major pull back thanks to the pandemic. Admittedly, comparing it to the giants of the industry may be unfair - but the strong signals of growth REED has shown in the recent past outpace or match it’s contemporaries as well. While the price point of its stock (considering market cap) has lagged far behind.

—————————————————————————

Executives and recent insider trades

John Bello - Chairman/Independent Director: John Bello accumulated experience in the sector first as an entrepreneur that created and managed “SoBe”, and then later as an executive with Pepsico after they acquired his company. The brand grew rapidly under his guidance, and its favorable acquisition by one of the giants of the beverage industry is testament to his ability. He is also a naval veteran, who left his position as lieutenant to pursue his education.

Norman E. Snyder - CEO: 
Norman E. Snyder is most notably (in my opinion) an accountant. A seemingly humble position that carries great weight as a CEO. Since taking on his position with Reed’s, he has done fantastic work refinancing the company and erasing bad debt. His previous experience within the industry includes being the COO of SoBe prior to its acquisition by Pepsi and COO Rheingold Brewing prior to its acquisition by Drinks America. Additionally - he founded a consulting firm, Redyns, which offered financial and operational consultancy to small and medium-sized companies.

Richard Hubli - Vice President of Operations: 
Put simply - this guy is the reason I’m convinced Reed’s Inc. has a bright future. He specializes in directing and creating effective supply chains. If you want to read more about him, here’s a link: https://patch.com/connecticut/norwalk/norwalk-based-reeds-inc-names-richard-h-hubli-vp-operations 
But what you really need to know is simple. The main choke that has always strangled Reed’s ability to grow its business has been its supply and distribution network. This dude came up with a stupid effective plan to restructure pretty much everything. The plan is still in the works, but its results are showing already - most recently with the deal they made with CVS to provide their beverages nationally. 

Recent insider activity (no one within the company has sold a share since 2019. They have exclusively added to their positions.) - https://imgur.com/a/gb9vMCF

4. Why I like the stock: 

Their product is fantastic and the company takes pride in what they’re making. Their fundamentals are solid and they’ve made nothing but excellent moves since restructuring their executive team. Their stock is obscenely undervalued. The only analyst to independently report REED’s estimated value gave it a price point of 1.50$. Hardly “obscenely undervalued” considering it’s trading just under 1$ now - right? Nope! Because that’s just what gets seen by most retail investor eyes. Read this -

“Analysts’ Opinion of REED
Many brokerage firms have already submitted their reports for REED stocks, with R. F. Lafferty repeating the rating for REED by listing it as a “Buy.” The predicted price for REED in the upcoming period, according to R. F. Lafferty is $5 based on the research report published on May 10th of the previous year 2019.
Lake Street, on the other hand, stated in their research note that they expect to see REED reach a price target of $6. The rating they have provided for REED stocks is “Buy” according to the report published on April 26th, 2019.
Maxim Group gave a rating of “Buy” to REED, setting the target price at $5.50 in the report published on April 25th of the previous year.”

So most brokerages see the stock as being 5X undervalued at a minimum. So why is it trading so far beneath its value? Simple. It’s been a short sellers dream stock.

—————————————————————————

Short Data:

I only realized how egregious the short selling of Reed’s is recently. Please free to check anything I say here https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/REED/short-interest/ against Ortex data, or from any other trusted source. I am always open to being incorrect.

On may 7th 2021: 700,00 shares were available to be shorted starting the day @ 0.6-0.8% borrow fee, ending the day @ 52.5% borrow fee.

On may 8th 2021: I can find no available data.

On may 9th 2021: I can find no available data.

On may 10th 2021: 500,000 shares were available starting @ 52.5% borrow fee, ending at 450,000 available @ 10.8%. 

So what the fuck happened? REED spiked do to the news that it successfully made a deal with CVS, retail investors eyes were drawn to it, they bought into a fundamentally undervalued stock, and then shorts absolutely hammered the hell out of it to steal away retail money. It’s that simple. As soon as this stock goes above 1.30$ - shorts attack without mercy to scare off retail. It’s fuckin’ abusive! For two whole days - every single share available to be used for shorting had already been used. Price still dropped despite low turnover rate on those days. Basically - I smell synthetic shares. And with a stock this cheap, showing the amount of growth potential it has, and with such a small free float (84 M) - it’s a dangerous fucking move to make. But it keeps working because no one else is watching. 

So help me out. For anyone with bigger wrinkles, check the info provided here and see if you can come up with a better explanation. For anyone smooth brained enough - consider buying a single share (it’s less than a buck right now) and hodling it regardless of what happens. I am heavily invested in AMC and assure you I’m not trying to distract from any other stocks. I just know that this is another good company with bright future - that is being absolutely suffocated in the short term for no sensible reason other than there being no one there to stop the shorts.

&gt; Live from New York, it's Tesla's competitors trying to steal the show from Elon Musk.

&gt; Four automakers aired electric vehicle commercials during the ""Saturday Night Live"" episode hosted by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

&gt; Lucid Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Volvo showcased electric vehicles in advertisements in a bid to grab a portion of the spotlight on a night featuring the billionaire widely credited with leading an EV revolution.

Excerpt:

&gt; Live from New York, it's Tesla's competitors trying to steal the show from Elon Musk.

&gt; Four automakers aired electric vehicle commercials during the ""Saturday Night Live"" episode hosted by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

&gt; Lucid Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Volvo showcased electric vehicles in advertisements in a bid to grab a portion of the spotlight on a night featuring the billionaire widely credited with leading an EV revolution.

And:

&gt; Ford showed the Mustang Mach-E, an electric crossover version of its famed pony car. Volkswagen showed off the VW ID.4, its first electric SUV. And Volvo showed off the XC-90 plug-in hybrid SUV.

stocks,Trying to find the next big growth stock is absolutely moronic and a good way to lose money,"Since the 2020 bull-run, I have been seeing a rising trend on social, and especially on Reddit, of people looking to buy deep into speculative stocks. It seems that each individual small-cap growth stock that is at least remotely known has some cult-like following attached it, convinced it will be the next FAANG.

Aside from some the obvious points, such as small-cap growth being prone to manipulation and pump n dump because of their small market cap, the historical data really shows picking winners is next to impossible.

The remaining 96% of stocks collectively were outperformed by US Treasury Bills. Statistically, you are likely to be better off not investing your money than you would be taking your chances on 96% of the stock market.

stocks,"19 years old. Dad forcing me to liquidate investments, but I want to hold.","Might be a bit off topic, but it's kind of a big deal for me and I don't know where else to turn to.

**SKIP TO PARAGRAPH 3 IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ EVERYTHING**

**P1** Context: I'm turning 19 soon, and I have been trading and investing for more than a year. I started with about 10K that I have saved during high school and decided I wanted to learn to trade the stock market. My dad had about 400K in cash at the time, and put in 25K in a separate account under his name for me so I can trade while avoiding the PDT rule. So in total I had 35K (10K mine, 25K his), but I was only allowed to spend my portion. I grew that 35K into 50K in a year, and my dad agreed he would let me use the 25K, on top of another 25K so that I can size my positions up. I understood the risks and agreed that I would pay him back if I lost any money. So at this point im at 75K, with 50K being his. I ended up growing that close to 100K.

TL;DR - 50K is his money, 50k was mine

**P2** Now, knowing the risks of the stock market I have always been emotionally and mentally prepared to lose all of my money, should that be the case. I started off just holding ARK funds and other stocks recovering from COVID, but started heavily rotating into small cap growth stocks, which amplified my gains. But obviously with more reward comes more risk, and I knew that. Whenever my stocks reached my price targets I took profits off the table. When the growth sector started getting hit hard in the past few months, I played it smart and sticked to my strategy, I took profits on a lot of my stocks, and took losses on my smaller positions. I still came out positive.

**P3** Here's the main issue: After selling out of a lot of my growth stocks, I cycled my money into recovery plays like Boeing, Visa, and American Express, which have all been doing decent, but I still left some pretty big position sizes in growth stocks that I had extremely high convictions for. More than 35% of my portfolio was in 3 growth stocks that I really believe will do well, I averaged down when it started to go negative, and sold some profits from recovery plays to keep averaging down. Now it's at least 65% of my portfolio. There hasn't been bad news with the fundamentals of these 3 companies, for the most part they seem to have been expanding and generating more revenue. If anything their stock prices should be going up, but the market's fear and uncertainty just isn't rewarding these fundamentals, and are instead dragging the stock prices down. I bought into these stocks because I believe they will do well by the end of the year, or 1 more year.

**P4** At this point my portfolio value is at 49K, meaning in terms of unrealized losses, I have lost all of my money. My dad asked me to liquidate everything, but agreed after some arguing that I can have 10K more leeway before he will force me to sell everything, as I have a stable job where I can afford to pay him minimum 2K a month as a part of that 10K.

**P5** Is there anything I can say that will convince him to let me hold these stocks in case there's a market crash, or more likely, if these stock prices go lower and brings my account value lower to 40K? I have a very strong conviction in these 3 companies, and the risk/reward ratio makes sense to me; if all of the money was mine I wouldn't feel stressed a tiny bit to hold it even if my account value went below 1K. When he initially let me use 50K he never said he needed it back by a certain time, I even told him I would gladly agree to keep paying him until I make up 50K. We have a good relationship and we trust each other, but he has a much more conservative mindset when it comes to investing and wants to play it much safer than I do. I understand his position, where he is risking 50K, whereas I'm only risking 10K. The worst case scenario for him is that he gets his money back later than sooner, but he said he doesn't want me to be in debt to him. But I genuinely feel like liquidating my positions and losing out on gains, if I turn out to be right, will feel much worse than losing all of my money.

**P6** Possible Outcomes:

1 - I risk letting my portfolio drop down to 40k, in which case I am forced to liquidate everything, and I am guaranteed to lose another 10K.

2 - I propose an alternative my dad will accept that will allow me to hold my investments.

3 - I liquidate everything now and I only lose what I originally put in, plus my 40K in gains. But I don't have to pay 10K in case the portfolio value would've dropped down to 40K.",1620689903,"19 years old. Dad forcing me to liquidate investments, but I want to hold.Might be a bit off topic, but it's kind of a big deal for me and I don't know where else to turn to.

**SKIP TO PARAGRAPH 3 IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ EVERYTHING**

**P1** Context: I'm turning 19 soon, and I have been trading and investing for more than a year. I started with about 10K that I have saved during high school and decided I wanted to learn to trade the stock market. My dad had about 400K in cash at the time, and put in 25K in a separate account under his name for me so I can trade while avoiding the PDT rule. So in total I had 35K (10K mine, 25K his), but I was only allowed to spend my portion. I grew that 35K into 50K in a year, and my dad agreed he would let me use the 25K, on top of another 25K so that I can size my positions up. I understood the risks and agreed that I would pay him back if I lost any money. So at this point im at 75K, with 50K being his. I ended up growing that close to 100K.

TL;DR - 50K is his money, 50k was mine

**P2** Now, knowing the risks of the stock market I have always been emotionally and mentally prepared to lose all of my money, should that be the case. I started off just holding ARK funds and other stocks recovering from COVID, but started heavily rotating into small cap growth stocks, which amplified my gains. But obviously with more reward comes more risk, and I knew that. Whenever my stocks reached my price targets I took profits off the table. When the growth sector started getting hit hard in the past few months, I played it smart and sticked to my strategy, I took profits on a lot of my stocks, and took losses on my smaller positions. I still came out positive.

**P3** Here's the main issue: After selling out of a lot of my growth stocks, I cycled my money into recovery plays like Boeing, Visa, and American Express, which have all been doing decent, but I still left some pretty big position sizes in growth stocks that I had extremely high convictions for. More than 35% of my portfolio was in 3 growth stocks that I really believe will do well, I averaged down when it started to go negative, and sold some profits from recovery plays to keep averaging down. Now it's at least 65% of my portfolio. There hasn't been bad news with the fundamentals of these 3 companies, for the most part they seem to have been expanding and generating more revenue. If anything their stock prices should be going up, but the market's fear and uncertainty just isn't rewarding these fundamentals, and are instead dragging the stock prices down. I bought into these stocks because I believe they will do well by the end of the year, or 1 more year.

**P4** At this point my portfolio value is at 49K, meaning in terms of unrealized losses, I have lost all of my money. My dad asked me to liquidate everything, but agreed after some arguing that I can have 10K more leeway before he will force me to sell everything, as I have a stable job where I can afford to pay him minimum 2K a month as a part of that 10K.

**P5** Is there anything I can say that will convince him to let me hold these stocks in case there's a market crash, or more likely, if these stock prices go lower and brings my account value lower to 40K?

Think NIO(&amp; other EVs), PLTR, BB, etc.

This is a specific question that I’ll build up to, I’ll try to keep it concise.

TLDR - what if the “growth tech boom” was an unachievable anomaly?

Hypothetical scenario for argument’s sake, using NIO just for it’s numbers:


-purchased at exact ATH of 66.99 (lmao never noticed that)

-Pre-covid price of ~$3-5

-Ignoring strong (or weak) fundamentals (of any of these companies, I’m talking “on balance” of the boom, maybe ARK is a better example, whatever)

-Ignoring the practice of DCA that would surely aide anybody’s chance at returns.

...

Let’s say sweet little NIO tumbles back to sub-$10 levels, and continues to do fantastically as a company. Their price starts to recover over 3-5 years, but never to that ATH? Maybe ever? 

My reason for asking is, what if the covid retail investor influx (truly an anomaly) pushed these stocks to such monstrous levels that, even if the stock appreciated favourably compared to pre-covid prices, (pretending the spike never happened), they may never return to such skyscraping prices as they did, barring another anomaly?


I understand and fully believe tech is the future (duh) and yes large tech stocks have multi multi bagged sustainably (FAANG) before. But I suppose the pain’s starting to get to me and I’m wondering if a true recovery for lots of these will happen, even if extreme fundamental progress continues to be made.

My heart tells me (especially when profitability is achieved) that much of these will exceed their ATH’s, but I’m curious as to yalls thoughts on the boom we just witnessed.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 10, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 10, 2021**

Stocks fell sharply on Monday, with technology stocks swiftly reversing from Friday to come under pressure once more as the risk of inflationary fears and recent suggestions from monetary officials weigh on the mind of market participants. The Nasdaq (QQQ) sank 2.53%, its worst performance since March. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones (DIA) reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) retreated from record levels, closing 0.95% down. 

Market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, it is important to note that monetary officials, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have repeatedly said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting he said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Looking ahead, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) is set to be released Wednesday and the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday. These will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens. 

Further spooking the markets is recent commentary from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen where she suggested interest rates may need to rise to prevent the economy from “overheating”. She said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she seemingly downplayed her remarks, saying that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.” 

While it may seem like doom and gloom, this is the most important piece of the puzzle and why one shouldn’t begin to panic about inflation or the economy overheating. Last Friday, the April Job Report reported only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below January 2020. The sharp decline in job growth allays fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy anytime soon, with Powell and other monetary officials consistently reiterating the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million jobs added before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report coming in far below estimates, the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is extremely unlikely to tighten its accommodative monetary policy anytime soon. 

In short, a transitory rise in inflation is not surprising given the economy is recovering from a severe decline in prices from March 2020, and while substantial progress has been made, economic recovery, particularly in the labor market, remains far from complete. 

**Highlights**

* Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) submitted an application with the US FDA to approve use of their coronavirus vaccine for individuals 16 and older
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary."" 
* The trial between Epic Games vs Apple (AAPL) has commenced. Epic has accused Apple of violating U.S. antitrust law and sued it in August after the tech giant yanked the developer's hit video game ""Fortnite"" from its App Store. Apple has defended itself by arguing that its app-marketplace policies are fair and that Epic breached a contract applicable to all developers distributing apps on its mobile devices by trying to make their own market place within the app store. Epic Games also sued Alphabet on similar grounds. Apple is facing a similar lawsuit in Europe filed by Spotify (SPOT)
* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans to hold a May 20 meeting with senior U.S. auto industry leaders and other industry officials on a semiconductor shortage that has cut production, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.
* No price target increases today, technical issue on our end :(

In short, a transitory rise in inflation is not surprising given the economy is recovering from a severe decline in prices from March 2020, and while substantial progress has been made, economic recovery, particularly in the labor market, remains far from complete. 

**Highlights**

* Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) submitted an application with the US FDA to approve use of their coronavirus vaccine for individuals 16 and older
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary."" 
* The trial between Epic Games vs Apple (AAPL) has commenced. Epic has accused Apple of violating U.S. antitrust law and sued it in August after the tech giant yanked the developer's hit video game ""Fortnite"" from its App Store. Apple has defended itself by arguing that its app-marketplace policies are fair and that Epic breached a contract applicable to all developers distributing apps on its mobile devices by trying to make their own market place within the app store. Epic Games also sued Alphabet on similar grounds. Apple is facing a similar lawsuit in Europe filed by Spotify (SPOT)
* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans to hold a May 20 meeting with senior U.S. auto industry leaders and other industry officials on a semiconductor shortage that has cut production, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.
* No price target increases today, technical issue on our end :(

Berry Global Group is an international packaging and protective solutions manufacturer. It was founded in 1967, bought out by Apollo in 2006, and brought public by Apollo in 2012.

It serves a diversified set of end markets including healthcare, food &amp; beverage, and consumer staples. These include companies such as Colgate, CVS Health, Kraft, Pepsi, etc. As it serves as a global provider of a diverse product line, it can benefit from very low costs of manufacturing which will be discussed later. 70% of its sales are in stable consumer-oriented end markets which explains its beta of 0.96. In addition, 51% of its business is in North America, with the remainder in EMEA and ROW.

**Internal Analysis**

From an internal point of view, Berry has sustained strong revenue and FCF growth over the past 5 years. This growth is supported by the fact that its average ROIC of 8.9% has consistently been above its WACC of 5.8%. This growth has been fueled through M&amp;A as Berry is constantly acquiring different global businesses to enter new segments or markets (such as the recent RPC acquisition). Through additional M&amp;A, Berry is able to increase its scale, giving it improved bargaining power with suppliers which assists them in keeping manufacturing prices low. This M&amp;A activity has also assisted them in entering new end-markets (AVINTIV and Healthcare) and new geographies.

**External Analysis**

From an external point of view, the global packaging industry is highly fragmented with singing barriers to entry. The top 5 players which include Amcor, Berry, Sonoco, Sealed Air, and Silgan make up 20% of the market. This fragmentation provides many opportunities for consolidation within the industry. The barriers to entry in the market include economies of scale, sticky international customers such as Unilever that treat their manufacturers as a one-stop-shop for all their packaging needs, and the purchasing power which creates a cost advantage for the larger companies. 

There are several tailwinds that benefit Berry and will drive long-term growth. Firstly, the demand for rigid and flexible plastic is greater than that for all-other packaging materials due to its versatility and lightweight. In addition, as Resin costs decrease, the margins in the industry will continue to improve, driving further growth. Moreover, as E-Commerce continues to rise at a CAGR of 17%, the industry will see increased demand given that many of its end markets will see volume increases due to E-Commerce as well.

**Investment Thesis 1: Competitive Moat**

The market has failed to recognize Berry’s competitive advantage and ability to generate growth, leading to a lower overall valuation than its intrinsic value. There is a prevailing narrative that a high level of fragmentation makes the industry competitive, and in turn product offerings are commoditized and results in margins being squeezed.

While this may apply to other companies, this narrative is incorrect for Berry for two primary reasons. One being its relative scale. Berry is able to maintain its high EBITDA margins through economies of scale, and its EBITDA margins are an average 2% higher than its peers. This is a result of its purchasing power. As one of the largest purchasers of resin, this is significant for Berry overall as resin accounts for \~50% of COGS, with COGS representing 72% of total sales in 2020. Furthermore, the high level of fragmentation provides profitable revenue growth for Berry via tuck-in acquisitions which further allow it to gain market share. It has a history of doing so thus far and has facilitated 50+ acquisitions within the space that have led to greater than anticipated synergies which have resultantly added to Berry’s overall competitive moat.

These acquisitions have also expanded Berry’s global footprint, by enabling them to capture CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) clients who have international operations and have a preference towards global suppliers. The most prominent recent acquisition of RPC gave Berry access to the EMEAI geography, which further helped strengthen its global presence.

Furthermore, Berry has a history of accretive activity contributable to its strong management and M&amp;A team. This has enabled Berry to acquire other businesses at favorable prices while successfully integrating them to generate strong returns. Its past 15 acquisitions resulted in an average \~5.2x post synergy EBITDA which is much higher than industry standards. Lastly, even some of its closest peers like Amcor often overpay for acquisitions, where Berry has always paid favorable prices that result in profound inorganic growth for the company. 

**Thesis 2: Debt Reduction**

Moreover, as Berry continues to reduce its debt, it will generate equity value creation and expand company multiples. Berry’s high leverage, currently 4.1x, has created a market inefficiency in its name as investors are either restricted from owning it or if not, have a systematic bias towards it. The market has missed Berry’s path to de-lever as it has publicly committed to reducing leverage to \~3.8x by FYE 2021. This is definitely achievable and Berry’s 8% FCF margin can support its commitment to de-lever. 

As Berry pays down debt, two primary things will occur. First, the value will accrue to equity holders, and second, there will be an overall increase in the number of investors interested in Berry, thereby increasing its multiples. These will make Berry more attractive to both retail and equity investors. Furthermore, there is also strong potential for Berry’s inclusion in the S&amp;P 400 index as leverage has been a contributing factor to its lack of inclusion as well as scope for active long funds to buy Berry. This would also resultantly drive incremental passive flows into Berry. 

Also, historically Berry has traded between 9.0x – 8.0x EV/NTM EBITDA when its leverage has been \~4.0x, which is a premium to where the stock is trading at today with \~7.3x 2021 EBITDA. This further implies that Berry’s multiples can expand if it continues to reduce leverage. Its close peer AMCOR is being valued by the market at \~4x EBITDA premium to BERY in large part due to a less leveraged capital structure. 

**Thesis 3: Plastic Misconception**

Lastly, Wall Street has a misconception on plastic and how quickly it will phase out, leading to an overwhelming negative sentiment for companies that supply such products. The global use of plastic and its overall trend is positive, and by 2025 plastic packaging is expected to increase even beyond current levels. 

Plastics create a lower environmental footprint than other comparable substrates as it uses less energy and water and generates less greenhouse-gas emissions and solid waste. However, because plastics are inexpensive, there is a post-consumer waste problem because recycling is not as economically viable. As a result, most plastic ends up being in a landfill as opposed to being recycled. Governments have realized this and focused their attention on banning single-use plastics, which Berry does not have exposure to, and have increased the use of recycled plastics. Berry is well prepared for this as a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, where Berry works with policymakers, NGOs, and local communities to build waste systems to increase recycling and work on product designs that facilitate the recycling of plastics. This is shown through its recent R&amp;D and product development initiatives such as soft-flex and booster spray, where it uses more sustainable and environmentally friendly products in its production process. Overall Berry has been misvalued by the market and is on a trajectory for an upward correction as the market's beliefs change. 

**Valuation: Comparable Companies**

From a comparables perspective, the median EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples for Berry’s peers are significantly higher than Berry’s indicating that Berry is trading at a significant discount. This is especially interesting when looking at competitors Amcor and AptarGroup, which have similar ROIC and yet lower revenue growth than Berry but are still trading at higher multiples. 

**Conclusion**

Overall the market is clearly missing Berry’s potential to be a leader in the global packaging industry and there is great potential for appreciation of the stock. This is definitely a stock to delve deeper into and value as there is significant room for growth.
