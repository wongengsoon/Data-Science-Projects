CryptoCurrency,I want to invest my savings into crypto as my bank keeps asking for more money every year.,"Well I was called to my local bank a few years ago as my youth account was running out. I was thinking that 4,99€ per month isn't that bad and decided to go for the cheapest option as I had all my savings in a free online bank that just asks for interest fees when you got into minus (I don't know if thats correct sorry, I mesn when you have less than 0 in your bankaccount).

Since then I got asked to come in as my bank contract was about change for like 4 timed. Every time getting the same abilities but for more money. We are now at 12,99€ a month. So I decided to close that account and transferred all my money to the online account.

I am now thinking about going into crypto as the money is just laying aroung loosing worth as there are no interests. I thought about Stellar and Tether but are there any chances I am missing out some opportunities?

CryptoCurrency,Am I biased by you all?,"Hi guys,

I started crypto in January, and I started with Exodus wallet because I knew nothing about exchange etx, all I read was that wallet is good, exchange is bad.

I bought bitcoin at the ticket machine in the train station (Switzerland) but it was 10% fees which is a lot! And after that I swapped BTC to the alts I wanted (too much fees too).

So the only choices I had was the crypto in Exodus! My first choices were :

1. Doge (for the meme, sold few months after for good profit)
2. ADA (for the staking in Exodus, didn't understand anything but looked fine to earn crypto like this)
3. VET (same reason, for the free VTHOR)

Now, I know a lot more than in January, I read a lot, I learn a lot here in this sub. The crypto I believe in now and that I want to hold for years are :

ADA, ETH/BTC, VET, DOT, MATIC, ONE, ALGO and maybe HBAR.

But when I read this sub, I recently started to think that this sub promotes these cryptos a lot and all my belief come from here... 

In another way, I bought ADA and VET by myself when I knew really nothing and not by reading this sub. So this is luck or good feeling.

Another thing that makes me thinking like this are my friends, we are swiss but french speakers. I am the only one who only read about crypto only in english. They learn with french youtubers, french websites etc. They are hyped by other cryptos that I didn't. Even some french youtubers are against some cryptos I chosed and my friends are telling me that ADA/VET are bad etc etc... And promote me french or swiss cryptos that are hyped by these french youtubers ! But they are sure like me so I can't say they are wrong...

Are we all biased by guys who want us to buy the same cryptos? I don't know what to think, I really think the cryptos I chosed are the future and I want to believe that this isn't only hype.

What do you think? How to be objective about crypto since we all believe that we chose the good cryptos?",1622016988,"Am I biased by you all?Hi guys,

CryptoCurrency,How do I take profits in a good way?,"I went into crypto seeing it more as a savings/investment account. I add a little to it every now and then, I stake, and I slowly see my portfolio grow with a couple of bucks everytime. My plan was to not touch it at all, and check back every couple of days to see what it's up to and to eventually cash out over 5-10-20 years. I am in BTC, ETH, LINK, VET, and HBAR.

I've seen the chaos ensue over the past few days and weeks, and while it didn't bother me because I invested with money I can afford, I might want to change tactics and take profits every now and then.

The one issue I have, or maybe I'm ignorant about it, is how to take profits. What if you sell, for example, 10% for a higher price than you bought and use that money again later for a cheaper price. What I don't understand is that there's not always going to be a cheaper price, right?

CryptoCurrency,Evaluating Altcoins,"You might find the world of crypto to be a bit confusing. You probably want to know how to tell a “scam” from real technology. There is really no perfect system but I wanted to share what I have learned so far. 

These are some of the methods I have developed methods to determine ways to investigate and learn about each type of blockchain, token, app or coin. 

This is not investment advice, it is just a few recommendations and some good sources of info. Don’t just buy what someone tells you to buy without looking into it! However, I do have a recommendation for newbies at the bottom of this post - look for “NEWBIES.”

1️⃣ The first question is: What is the coin’s current value derived from? 

- Is it a meme coin? 
- Is it massively hyped?
- Is it some future promise of tech that isn’t finished? (This is in a way a meme coin.)
- Does it have actual functionality now or does it have massive future potential functionality?
- Are there people using it for a unique purpose that brings them value and creates demand? 

Many coins derive value from memes and armies of people spreading those memes. Sometimes those memes promise future functionality. There is nothing wrong with that per se, but it’s the schemiest of schemes - and it likely will not stand the test of time without building real tech - except for a few exceptions which could have powerful enough memes that they become some sort of weird digital currency religion. 

To find out more about a coin, use the sources below. Also please share other good neutral sources in the comments! 

2️⃣ The next question is: Where can I learn more about a coin? 
- Messari.io - if the coin is listed here, then this is probably the best source of neutral information you can find. 
- dappradar.com - shows the number of users on apps that use coins on most of the biggest Blockchains
- blocktivity.info- shows the number of transactions on each blockchain (this can be gamed easily, so make sure you look for a “!” on the stats which shows something is sus)
- CoinGecko.com - (also pretty neutral as CMC is owned by Binance) this site shows current and historical prices and trading volumes for most coins (if a coin has little to no volume, then this will affect your ability to trade it)... 
- CoinGecko.com - you can also find a link to the actual coin’s website and Telegram here where you can go to learn more about the coin. 
- Tokensniffer.com - great for identifying scams!! Search the coin name and see if there were any coins using the same code before... or if there are any signals of a scam. (Note: this only works for ETH coins.)

You can learn so much from these sites I have listed above. If you want to go deeper (and you should) go visit the website of the coin. Every coin should have a main website listed on CoinGecko.

3️⃣ What to look for on a coin’s website? 
- Coin’s Whitepaper - these can be technical, but worth looking at before investing. Ask a technical friend to review it if there are a lot of things you don’t understand.
- Coin’s Roadmap - is there a roadmap? Have they executed it? Are they on target or way behind schedule? 
- Founders - are they active? Still involved? What else have they done? 
- GitHub - does the project open source code? What exactly is in the repositories? (You may need to ask a dev for help, there are many here in this sub. Post questions!)

😳Beware fanatics! 

There are a lot of fanatical people supporting projects. Try to find neutral sources of info. Don’t just listen to fanatical zealots - go to the links I’ve posted.

🎂NEWBIES - What altcoin should you buy first?

If you are really new to crypto - consider buying USDC and staking it on Celsius or Abra to earn a free 10% on stable USD coins. Each coin is worth $1 and is backed by a US-based and insured company. It’s very low risk and you will earn way more than you would in a bank account.

Then you can always unstake some USDC and trade that to buy altcoins as you learn more. 

🕛 Timing Matters 

If you buy into crypto when everyone is talking about it and it’s on the news every day - you might be buying at or near the top.

Best thing is to buy when no one is talking about blockchain or when the news talks about a HUGE crash - that could be a good signal to buy. Don’t risk buying at the top of the market - then selling at the bottom. 

In the end, everything else is a gamble. There is no 100% sure way to make money.

Remember, this is gambling and the market is highly volatile. 

If you have $1000 to lose, also consider dollar-cost-averaging and try to be patient and buy $200 each week over 5 weeks. Don’t just ape 🦧 into something. 

Good luck! 🍀",1622012071,"Evaluating AltcoinsYou might find the world of crypto to be a bit confusing. You probably want to know how to tell a “scam” from real technology. There is really no perfect system but I wanted to share what I have learned so far. 

These are some of the methods I have developed methods to determine ways to investigate and learn about each type of blockchain, token, app or coin. 

This is not investment advice, it is just a few recommendations and some good sources of info. Don’t just buy what someone tells you to buy without looking into it! However, I do have a recommendation for newbies at the bottom of this post - look for “NEWBIES.”

1️⃣ The first question is: What is the coin’s current value derived from? 

- Is it a meme coin? 
- Is it massively hyped?
- Is it some future promise of tech that isn’t finished? (This is in a way a meme coin.)
- Does it have actual functionality now or does it have massive future potential functionality?
- Are there people using it for a unique purpose that brings them value and creates demand? 

Many coins derive value from memes and armies of people spreading those memes. Sometimes those memes promise future functionality. There is nothing wrong with that per se, but it’s the schemiest of schemes - and it likely will not stand the test of time without building real tech - except for a few exceptions which could have powerful enough memes that they become some sort of weird digital currency religion. 

To find out more about a coin, use the sources below. Also please share other good neutral sources in the comments! 

2️⃣ The next question is: Where can I learn more about a coin? 
- Messari.io - if the coin is listed here, then this is probably the best source of neutral information you can find. 
- dappradar.com - shows the number of users on apps that use coins on most of the biggest Blockchains
- blocktivity.info- shows the number of transactions on each blockchain (this can be gamed easily, so make sure you look for a “!” on the stats which shows something is sus)
- CoinGecko.com - (also pretty neutral as CMC is owned by Binance) this site shows current and historical prices and trading volumes for most coins (if a coin has little to no volume, then this will affect your ability to trade it)... 
- CoinGecko.com - you can also find a link to the actual coin’s website and Telegram here where you can go to learn more about the coin. 
- Tokensniffer.com - great for identifying scams!! Search the coin name and see if there were any coins using the same code before... or if there are any signals of a scam. (Note: this only works for ETH coins.)

You can learn so much from these sites I have listed above. If you want to go deeper (and you should) go visit the website of the coin. Every coin should have a main website listed on CoinGecko.

3️⃣ What to look for on a coin’s website? 
- Coin’s Whitepaper - these can be technical, but worth looking at before investing. Ask a technical friend to review it if there are a lot of things you don’t understand.
- Coin’s Roadmap - is there a roadmap? Have they executed it? Are they on target or way behind schedule? 
- Founders - are they active? Still involved? What else have they done? 
- GitHub - does the project open source code? What exactly is in the repositories? (You may need to ask a dev for help, there are many here in this sub. Post questions!)

😳Beware fanatics! 

There are a lot of fanatical people supporting projects. Try to find neutral sources of info. Don’t just listen to fanatical zealots - go to the links I’ve posted.

🎂NEWBIES - What altcoin should you buy first?

If you are really new to crypto - consider buying USDC and staking it on Celsius or Abra to earn a free 10% on stable USD coins. Each coin is worth $1 and is backed by a US-based and insured company. It’s very low risk and you will earn way more than you would in a bank account.

Then you can always unstake some USDC and trade that to buy altcoins as you learn more.

CryptoCurrency,Reached a Minor Achievement: transferred my ADA into a wallet and staked it to start earning rewards.,"Ever since my first small purchase of ADA, I've wanted to stake it to earn some interest/reward. However I was scared I'd mess it up and kept it sitting in Coinbase. However, I managed to gain some confidence by reading the instructional and informational posts here that finally encouraged me enough to make the move. 

I set up my Yoroi wallet, did a tiny test transfer,  transfered the remainder of my tiny ADA sum, and made an initial delegation selection. I'm looking forward to my first rewards. 

I also set up an ALGO wallet and transferred a small amount there to test earning rewards while the rest earns in Coinbase. 

To help me feel more secure about the move, I also followed the tips and started backing up my wallet phrases, though I still need to choose one or two more means to back them up for extra security. Also, now that I'm sure crypto will be a long term hold/investment for me, I'm starting to consider a physical wallet. 

As a side question, I just wanted to confirm that there's nothing similar I can do with my new XLM holdings right now other than just hold, right?

Thank you all for so much generous and useful information and helping me start on what is hopefully a new and successful path in life.",1622011877,"Reached a Minor Achievement: transferred my ADA into a wallet and staked it to start earning rewards.Ever since my first small purchase of ADA, I've wanted to stake it to earn some interest/reward.

CryptoCurrency,Mining Council Will Defend Bitcoin Against Uninformed and Hostile Energy Critics,"According to an article on CoinDesk

The Bitcoin Mining Council hopes to ""Manage concerns, especially from uninformed parties"" about the cryptocurrency's energy usage, Microstrategy CEO and bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor said.

The Bitcoin Mining Council was born of a desire to help shape the narrative around the cryptocurrency's energy use, said MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor.

Saylor said he connected Musk with the eight North American bitcoin miners to host a discussion around energy usage.

Saylor, who is known for speaking of the benefits of bitcoin as he added over 92,000 BTC to his company's balance sheet, raised the ire of the community on Monday by announcing that he hosted fellow billionaire Musk and a handful of mining firms in forming the Bitcoin Mining Council.

Sunday's closed-door session of bitcoin miners seeking to change how network participants report their energy use wasn't made public until after the fact, showing a lack of ""Self-awareness,"" wrote Great American Mining co-founder Marty Bent.However, Peter Wall, CEO of council member Argo Blockchain, said Monday the group does not plan to change any aspect of the bitcoin ecosystem, just address environmental concerns.

""I think Elon's first-order ask was 'hey, can we come up with a way to publish or [boost] transparency for bitcoin mining energy usage,'"" Saylor said Tuesday.

""We need to make sure that people that are hostile to bitcoin and hostile to the crypto industry aren't defining these narratives and defining those models and defining those metrics,"" he said.",1622011488,"Mining Council Will Defend Bitcoin Against Uninformed and Hostile Energy CriticsAccording to an article on CoinDesk

CryptoCurrency,The state of the shape of the space.,"I’m technically still Rookie (November 2020) but I’ve taken the pursuit of functional and objective knowledge of the digital asset space as seriously as I’ve taken anything in my life.( I was a Heroin addict for about a decade so there’s my “bar” for serious) 

Since my entry, the space has changed a great deal.  I say this having already contested my own claim with the reality that MY change has also been vast. 

For whatever extremely interesting reason there is almost a complete lack of uniformity when it comes to the way people receive digital assets and all that comes with that.  No guarantee of allegiances or even that something like allegiances matter to these wipersnapers; which is fine. Almost every bitch about someone’s varied tastes is, from the get, in opposition with the decentralized narrative the space wears like a saggy, over-worn, under washed epidermis. 

A reality that is never brought out to breathe is the fact that though investor perspective and therefore behavior is multitudinous, the swarm barely differs in their passion and codependency on said beliefs.  In short; people all walk into to same space but through different doors with different avenues before that.  Everything leading up to that entry typically plays a role as default teacher because not everyone volunteers their time and sacrifice to engage in objective, unbiased self education about the intricacies and mechanisms that compose the vehicle being considered to STORE YOUR ENTIRE EXISTENCES WEALTH AND WILL POWER.   

Just reading that line answers so many overlooked and perpetually argued points of needless contention between camps or asset clubs or whatever the kids and their MTV are doing...

This started as a post made to comment on the, in my eyes, “extra” side of the space. The cellulite backstraps made up of one side suicidal leverage and the other some hedonistic micro economy based on viral dogs and their “wow” are best described as a carnival show. The midway at the state fair. Enjoyable only though temporary novelty; the hyper-artificial coating shrink wrapped around everything but that second to none stench.   Nothings going to stop that loose cannon of rank. 

Indeed there seem to be too many wild guns shooting only for the party that comes with the trigger and forget about aiming or collateral. 

In short, I’d say immaturity is the obstacle those with properly adjusted eyes are destined to watch be overcome. 

I love all the ridiculous twists and turns, can’t write this shit. And I won’t speak my affiliation other than saying this: I hodl with purpose. It’s through this crafted purpose that I don’t have to worry about the noise and it’s multiples. All the doom and gloom and uncertainty and trust issues; there’s an asset for that.

CryptoCurrency,"live, live, live. This is a bull that will get off the ground again.","I know what a bear market feels like. I'm a silver bug.  I don't think crypto is in a bear market. There is far too much currency and derivatives floating around looking for a magnetic pull into something new and tangible. Far more than 2 trillion dollars. 

Crypto is a new shore for currency to naturally flow too.

I'm just being careful as to which crypto shore I'm going to trade my fiat for.

I still believe as a silver bug that silver is  extremely undervalued. I also reason  that belief of being dead right, sometimes feels like being dead. So I'm going to throw some of my hat into the crypto wild west. Seems like fun.

I hope some in the crypto world take a look at precious metals as another hedge. I'd say it looks nicer than a sheeba at this point, but who am I? 

I believe the lack of precious metals will expose a derivatives nightmare soon, I also believe there are more lifeboats for people to get on when the dollar implodes and the best cryptos will soar.",1622010035,"live, live, live.

CryptoCurrency,Not a understanding the fees.,So I needed a new hobby and foolishly I choose crypto. I got into it 6 months ago and now I’m an addicted. I’m look over articles on coins I want to invest in and watch videos about them just to try and decide if it is a good investment. Don’t forget the graphs sooooo many charts I look at about past trends and how to try and foolishly predict the market. The biggest question I have still though is how the fees work. I wanted to store some ETH in BUSD and the fee was $16 Dollars. Are they based on a percentage or how busy the network is? I just would like to know how I can take out my coins and set the money aside if I think a big dip is coming without loosing 20 percent of my earnings. I understand why there are fees and I’m cool with paying some but I just would love to find a place that explains all of it and how it works on the different block chain. Any help would be awesome.,1622009917,Not a understanding the fees.So I needed a new hobby and foolishly I choose crypto. I got into it 6 months ago and now I’m an addicted.

CryptoCurrency,So we just had the dip: Did you buy it?,"First: This is not a prediction post - it's just a simple take on strategy for when you have decided which prediction to put your trust/money in.

The BTC \~$34k and ETH \~$1700k were recently (2 days ago) the prices where most people would be able to react and buy. 

I've seen multiple posts here and other places, where people tout $25k as the dip for BTC. What happens is that to be sure to buy that dip, those who will do that will often place their orders higher, in order to make sure they get in. It seems to have been in the 32-35k area which is not surprising; you estimate the low and then add 10% to have a safety margin. Some will add more, and some will simply pick 30k because it's a nice round number.

For me, it's like calculating the high. If I estimate that $60k will be the top followed by a significant retraction, I will place a sell order at roughly 10% below that; meaning in the $54-55k area. 

I bought both BTC and ETH this time around, although larger gains could obviously have been made if I'd had the nerve to put it all in smaller cryptocurrencies such as GVT, VET, LRC or OGN. However, these were too risky for me and so I went with BTC and ETH. I managed to buy in at $34.5k for BTC and $1800k for ETH, which I'm fairly satisfied with. 

For day traders, it's not about buying the absolute dips and selling at the perfect highs; these short-lived prices are impossible to predict accurately and consistently. Getting 4-7% out of each trade cycle is the goal - especially if you can do it multiple times per week.

As the Elon-China effects on the cryptomarket seem to have subsided for now, we're seeing a rush of money pouring back in - and although I started by writing that this is not a prediction post, it's fairly safe to say that there will be a certain amount of FOMO during today and/or tomorrow, when it's been made clearer that the gains from yesterday and today will continue. This will of course drive the prices higher. How high and for how long is anyone's guess though.",1622008498,"So we just had the dip: Did you buy it?First: This is not a prediction post - it's just a simple take on strategy for when you have decided which prediction to put your trust/money in.

I was fortunate enough to buy the dip recently, then took profit, and overall and made a 12% return on a €100 investment, within a day. It seems that on a free day, spending some time watching trading signals, I can make some bucks, and it's fun as well. However, I used bitpanda to do this, and there are heavy trading fees.

I have been into crypto for a month and half so still newbie compared to most people here but I researched into it and I start having a grasp on the basic concepts and lingo.

I want to find a website with as low trading fees as possible so I can micro trade dips and tops when I want to spend some time on this. I have a hard time understanding the various exchanges.

I can accept fees from putting in or out fiat from the exchanges, as long as the actual trading (swaps/sells/buys) can be done with minimal fees.

What are your battle hardened suggestions in that regard and could you detail a bit how it works?

Best regards.",1622005493,"Trading with minimal feesDear fellow crypto investors/day traders,

He’s the reason I have a TFSA set up for long term investing. He’s the reason I opened a personal trading account with more short term trading abilities. He’s the reason I am saving now in order to invest in my future. 


Crypto is all over the place now. Even if you are just a stock market investor, you’ve now heard of crypto and probably pretty often in the last month. Naturally he wants to take a dip as a retired man with plenty of money to play with. He knows I’ve invested a bit into crypto although it’s only been a couple of months now. There’s been a bit of chat back and forth regarding it and now he wants to pull the trigger. 


I’d like to state that my father and I have an incredible relationship. Money has never been a problem between us, he’s done very, very well for himself and I think he could enjoy some crypto trading. Many people try to prohibit giving financial advice to their family which I totally get. I want to guide my Dad without giving my opinion too much I guess? Are there any tricks out there?

CryptoCurrency,Ethereum Q1 Highlights,"**Ethereum Q1 Highlights:** 

**Key Results**

* **Total transaction fees**, also known as network revenue, increased 200x to $1.7 billion in Q1 2021, compared with $8 million in Q1 2020. For the month of April, Ethereum generated annualized revenue run rate of $8.6 billion—comparable to AWS in 2015.
* **Total transaction volume** on Ethereum increased 20x to $713 billion in Q1 2021, compared with $33 billion in Q1 2020.
* **Median transaction fee** increased 126x to $7.63 in Q1 2021, compared with $0.06 in Q1 2020.
* **Daily active addresses**, a proxy for daily active users, increased 71% to 607k in Q1 2021, compared with 364k in Q1 2020.
* **Staked Ethereum** reached 3.6 million ETH in Q1 2021. Staking was launched in December 2020.

**Ecosystem Results**

* **Decentralized exchange (DEX) volume** increased 76x to $177 billion in Q1 2021, compared with $2.3 billion in Q1 2020.
* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) total value locked** increased 64x to 52 billion in Q1 2021, compared with $0.8 billion in Q1 2020.
* **Stablecoin value on Ethereum** increased 5x to $41.9 billion at quarter end Q1 2021, compared with $7.1 billion at quarter end Q1 2020.
* **Wrapped BTC volume** increased 95x to 170k BTC in Q1 2021, compared with 1.8k BTC in Q1 2020. Approximately 1% of bitcoin supply is wrapped as ERC-20 tokens and traded on top of Ethereum.
* **NFT art sales** increased 560x to $396 million in Q1 2021, compared with $0.7 million in Q1 2020.

Ethereum’s strong Q1 growth was not without pains. Gas prices spiked in Q1 due to the incredible popularity of DeFi and NFT applications. Level 2 scaling, which is already being deployed across the ecosystem, aims to alleviate congestion and bring cost and power consumption down to near zero.

**Ethereum Ecosystem Highlights**

* **Metamask**—the popular Ethereum wallet for desktop and mobile—reached 4 million monthly active users (MAUs) in Q1 and crossed 5 million MAUs in April. Metamask mobile saw strong global growth, especially in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Nigeria. Metamask’s MAUs is now comparable to mainstream consumer applications such as Robinhood and Clubhouse.
* **Visa** announced that it now settles payments in the USDC stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. This makes Visa the first major payments network to use stablecoin as a settlement currency.
* **Meitu**—a Chinese mobile software company—bought 16,000 ETH for its balance sheet. Meitu’s board has allocated up to $100 million for the purchase of cryptocurrencies to diversify its treasury. Ethereum makes up its largest position. Meitu is also evaluating launching applications on the ethereum blockchain.
* **Canada** approved four ETFs for buying and trading ether. Evolve Ether ETF (TSX: ETHR), CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF (TSX: ETHX), Purpose Ether ETF (TSE: ETHH), and 3iQ CoinShares Ether ETF (TSX:ETHQ) provide easy and cost effective ways to hold ether within a traditional brokerage account.

**Outlook**  
2021 is perhaps the most important year in Ethereum’s history. The two key themes for 2021 are economic security and scalability.

In April the Ethereum core dev team approved EIP1559—a software update that improves the bid process for block space and introduces a burn mechanism for the base portion of the transaction fee. Fee burn will offset a substantial portion of Ethereum issuance, paving the way for long term network security with minimum dilution. EIP1559 is on track to be deployed on test nets on June 9th followed by official rollout via the London hard fork on July 14th.

Ethereum has a dual pronged approach to scaling network capacity—rollups and sharding. Rollups batch and compress transactions off-chain, increasing transaction throughput by \~100x. Sharding breaks the Ethereum main chain into sub-chains to enable parallel computation, further improving throughput by \~100x. By employing both technologies, Ethereum 2.0 at maturity could process upward of 100,000 transactions per second versus 15 today.

In early Q2, Ethereum ecosystem partners launched a number of projects powered by rollups.

dYdX launched its zk-rollup platform for perpetual futures trading while Immutable X launched a zk-rollup based platform for minting and trading NFTs. Transactions via rollups consume negligible energy compared to the main chain, addressing one of the main criticisms of the NFT economy. Uniswap—the most popular decentralized exchange for Ethereum is expected to launch rollups via Optimism in the coming weeks.

Toward the end of the year, Ethereum aims to switch from its current proof of work algorithm to proof of stake. The initial version of the proof of stake chain (“beacon chain”) was released in December 2020. On May 12th developers conducted a successful merge of the two chains in a test environment. Proof of stake will reduce Ethereum’s energy consumption by 99% while providing democratic access to staking rewards for all ETH holders.

**Balance Sheet**  
At the start of Q1 2021, the Ethereum Foundation’s treasury had 460k ether valued at $560 million. At the end of Q1 2021, the treasury’s balance was 430k ether, valued at $826 million. The Ethereum Foundation spent 30k ether during the quarter but the treasury’s value in USD terms grew due to ether-USD appreciation.

#Elon &amp; Cameron Winklevoss Meet

***

*What happens when two iconoclast meet at a charity luncheon? Love at first sight.*

***

It was an uptight occasion, black-tie, marble statues adorning the tulip garden, classical music serenading the air. Elon fidgeted in his tuxedo, he didn’t really enjoy the pomp—he’d rather be blowing up rockets. Little did he know, he was being admired by a stranger hiding behind a sculpted shrub. Elon’s secret admirer was tall, with the body of a competitive rower.

Elon sipped at his drink, twirling the straw between his fingers. 

“These things are always so boring.” He said to himself. 

His admirer approached from his perch behind the shrub. His heart was racing as he stepped towards Elon. It was almost as exhilarating as race day.

“Whatcha drinking there?” The tall man said.

“Oh, nothing too fancy. Just apple juice.” Elon spun the straw in the drink. “Enjoying it while I can. There won’t be much fresh apple juice where I’m going... which is mars.”

The tall man chuckled. “So I’ve heard.” He clumsily sat his drink down on the table and stuck out his hand. “I’m Cameron Winklevoss. I’m your biggest fan.”

Elon grinned, “finally something interesting” he thought. 

“I own all your cars, er, Telsa’s. I bought one of every model.”

Elon took a long self-satisfying sip from the straw. “Always glad to meet another fan.”

Camerons beamed. “And the space stuff. That’s super cool too. Mars and shit. Hell yeah.” He wasn’t used to fumbling with his words before. 

“Yup. Rockets and I even dig holes underground sometimes.” 

“Cool, cool.” Cameron took a deep breathe. “I’m heavy into this thing, this silly thing. Its gonna revolutionize finance. Its called bitcoin.”

Elons eyebrows rose. “The internet coins, right?”

“Exactly. Its hard to explain but...” Cameron looked round to make sure no one else was listening, “but if you wanted to come into my bedroom,” he cleared his throat, “then I could *show* you instead.”

“Now *that* sounds interesting...” Elon sucked the last of his drink. *KLLLLUUURRRRP* “Please, lead the way.”

Cameron slipped his arm around Elons shoulder as he lead him toward the mansion. Inside was clad in marble pillars, decorated with flexing nude statues sculpted in bronze. Camerons room was cozier than the hall of sculptures, what with the thick carpet and plush bedspread.

“Have a seat on my bed. I’ll grab my laptop.” He closed the door.

“This bitcoin is some kind of online payment schema, right?” Elon sank into the duvet. 

“Sorta. But its so much more.” The optimism rang through his voice. “It could someday displace... the US dollar. Maybe even gold.”

Elon laughed. “Now that I’d like to see.” 

Cameron sat next to Elon on the bed and opened his laptop. “Bitcoin could revolutionize the world!”

“You sound a lot like I used to.” Elon sighed. “I got into some crazy stuff back in college. I’m sure you’ve heard. Paypal.”

“Everyone knows about Paypal.” Cameron said. 

“It was a wild time. Lots of late nights in a dorm room full of horny undergrads...” Elon cleared his throat, “I mean tired undergrads. Lots of long hours.”

“But you guys made it work.” Cameron gazed into his eyes. “You made your dream of online payment domination a reality. No matter what it took.” 

Elon rubbed his hands on his knees. “Miss those days. Pure, unadulterated, innovation.”

“Thats what we’re doing with bitcoin.” Cameron placed his hand over Elons. “You can experience the magic again.”

“Really? At my age?”

“Are you ever too old to fall in love again?” Cameron squeezed his hand.

“I’d...” Elon blushed, “I’d like to find out...”

Their eyes locked, when the knob began to rattle. The door swings open, Cameron quickly withdrawals his embrace. 

“Tyler!” He shouted. “You know you’re suppose to knock first.”

“What are you doing in here, bro?” An identical mass of rower stood in the doorway. “You’re missing the party.”

“I was just showing Mr. Musk some bitcoin stuff.” 

“Hello,” he waved, “You can call me Elon.”

“Psshh.” Tyler stepped up and slammed the laptop lid shut. “On your personal computer? Comon bro. You trying to get Zuckerburged again?”

“Tyler! Rude!” 

Tyler was a bit rude. He’d been burned before. He wasn’t afraid to use his massive size to get his way.

“Its alright.” Elon smiled and looked at Cameron. “I think I’ve heard enough to understand.” He rushed to his feet, careful to conceal the rocket that was in his pocket. “I’ll give you my card, we’ll talk more later?” 

Cameron tried his best to smile casually. “Great. Fantastic. Yes, we’ll speak more...” 

Elon handed him a business card then awkwardly squeezed past Tylers foreboding form in the doorway. Cameron fell backwards on the bed, he sniffed the fragrance on Elons card. “Great timing, brother. I had him in the palm of my hands.”

Tyler closed the door behind him. “We have to be careful. We can’t trust anybody this time. There’s more than money riding on bitcoin. You know that.”

“What if he’s the one that was foretold of?”

“We don’t need the prophet to stop Zuckerburg.”

“You might not.” Cameron sighed. “But *I* do.”

“Do you think Zuck is afraid of his kind?” Tyler grabbed the laptop and sat it on the table. “You know what its going to take,” his tone softened to his mom voice, “and Zuck won’t be stopped by rockets or electric sports cars.”

Cameron leaned up from the bed. “He hand built paypal. That *has* to count for something?”

Tyler sat beside Cameron and gave him the mom nudge. “I’m just not sure if thats the rational Cameron talking or the...you know.”

“Its not emotional. He might not be an oarsman but he has other strengths.”

Tyler sighed. “Thats what I’m worried about, it sounds like you’re in *love* with him.”

CryptoCurrency,Is utility the future of Crypto?,"Hi All,

I have been into crypto since the beginning of the year and have been soaking up all the info I can since then, from market cycles to chart formations and everything in between. I have gone from someone who avoids all social media to being on reddit, twitter, discord, and telegram, with constant YouTube information vids playing on YouTube constantly 🙈

One thing that really seems to stick with me is that in the near future it will be utility that drives crypto, from NFT creation, decentralised finance, traceability and ease of use. XRP and VET are two that really pushing forward I believe, though I know there is alot more out there.

I believe covid has had an effect on speeding up the process of the digitization of the financial world.

I am very skeptical on the news I hear and know that there is great manipulation within the market, and I am working on resisting my emotions to maximise profits.

Any viewpoints or recommendations of crypto with real use case welcome, for me to start some more research on 😜

IMO the recent crash we had is what is know as the shakout, happens each bullrun, this is followed by the real bull top and the parabolic explosion of the majority of the alt coins, EOY will be exciting and I imagine my crypto will sit in savings until then.

CryptoCurrency,Investing in real coins,"I am fairly new to this space. I recently invested in Cardano (ADA) because I truly believe in their project and the good things that they are doing in other countries. Even though jumping on those meme coins seems enticing, I want to be true to myself and not give in to the whole ""get rich quick buy meme coins"" scheme.

So my question is, how do you guys find promising crypto coins? The space seems flooded with so many scams, and meme coins and I have a hard time believing anything that they are doing. It took me a while to get into Cardano because of this.

Articles, YouTubers, and so on seem so biased for personal gain or just sound like they are simply pulling numbers. (This is from a true beginner's point of view so I may be wrong). Any resources will be amazing.

A lot of people say ""do your own research"", but honestly, I am having a hard time trying to find quality information that is unbiased. So I thought I should maybe ask people who have first-hand experience trading crypto about any general rules, tips, resources that they follow.

CryptoCurrency,I believe we’ll see significant movement between Friday and June 15th.,"Arguably the biggest reason for bitcoins recent crash was the US inflation report which reported way over estimates. The timeline of the crash corresponds with the report. This affected everything from stocks to bonds to crypto as people sold volatile assets for fear of rising interest rates and a slowing economy. Basically rising inflation = rising prices = less spending = less profits = rising interest rates from feds to compensate = potential economic recession = markets crashing. This is really concerning to investors and most people haven’t paid attention. The market is uncertain because we are uncertain how feds will respond to this report. Will they raise interest rates? Will they curb federal Covid support to stop printing money? Will they let overinflation happen? Who knows. This pandemic is new to navigate for so many of us. 

The next report comes out this Friday and the next fed meeting is June 15th according to Reuters. They have assured the public that they will be able to reign it back in softly without crashing the economy but that’s tough and we’ll see what happens. Either way, in the long term Bitcoin has a bright future as people flee from the dollar and run to rising store of value assets either way this goes. 

Whatever they say and decide between Friday and mid-June will start to move the crypto market again. Those are my thoughts.

Keyword is TRUSTWORTHY exchange. Obviously don't keep your crypto on some shoddy exchange which will most likely exit scam in 3 months. But if you keep your crypto on an exchange like Coinbase Pro or Kraken, you are fine. Coinbase insures your crypto unto a certain amount (which 99% of the times is more than enough to cover your whole portfolio). Also, Coinbase/Kraken have world-class engineers working on it so it's not some 2014 shit exchange like Mt. Gox. Crypto has evolved a lot from those times.

Keyword is TRUSTWORTHY exchange. Obviously don't keep your crypto on some shoddy exchange which will most likely exit scam in 3 months. But if you keep your crypto on an exchange like Coinbase Pro or Kraken, you are fine. Coinbase insures your crypto unto a certain amount (which 99% of the times is more than enough to cover your whole portfolio). Also, Coinbase/Kraken have world-class engineers working on it so it's not some 2014 shit exchange like Mt. Gox. Crypto has evolved a lot from those times. Coinbase is literally a public company subject to certain regulations.

CryptoCurrency,DD: Orion Terminal,"Just as a disclaimer, I do own a bit of Orion. It seems to fly a bit under the radar so I figured I would make a post talking about it with some actual research.
____

Orion is a exchange terminal that aggregates purchases from every CEX, DEX, and swap pool in one platform without any KYC. 1inch is similar to Orion, but does not aggregate any CEX. So you can use Binance or Coinbase but not need an account or to verify your identity and share your drivers license and such.

What this means is that if you purchase a coin on Orion, it gets you the best price across every DEX and CEX with the best fees. For example, the other day using Orion to purchase ETH would have saved you roughly $150 as compared to Uniswap due to gas fees. You also get a discount on fees for owning Orion. During the dip last week when people were complaining about issues with centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance ORN continued to aggregate transactions through those exchanges like they weren’t down.

Just last week they launched the BSC bridge which allows users to trade ERC20 coins on the BSC and avoid ETH gas fees altogether. This means that you no longer need to buy these coins on Uniswap and pay $100 in gas fees for your purchase. It’s huge and got lost in all the chaos of the dip.

This is all great, but what about staking? Well ORN staking, when it launches on mainnet soon (currently on KuCoin it’s 22%) is gearing up to be some of the best staking in crypto. Staking APY is determined by terminal volume, number of coins staked across the network, how long you want to lock them, and Orion price. So if the terminal volume was at 1inch’s volume with 17 million Orion staked (I chose about halfway) and at current price of $8 then you’re seeing 191% APY. If we take the volume to Uniswap volume and it’s ATH of around $30 we see 209% APY

So what your staking does on Orion is two things. You can be a broker or a non-broker. If you’re a broker then you run an Orion Broker Software with accounts across multiple exchanges. This software allows their computers to automatically execute trades routed from the liquidity aggregator via their trading accounts. This is the basis of how the terminal works. Brokers are chosen to execute trades based on how much ORN they stake in the Decentralized Brokerage. Brokers receive a portion of fees from each trade they execute. This is called Delegated Proof of Broker (DPoB)

Now for most people here, you won’t be a broker. You’ll be staking as a non-broker. Non-Broker stakers stake ORN to ‘vote’ for their choice of broker based on the variable reward share offered. Brokers are incentivized to offer attractive rates to non-broker stakers to grow their stake, increasing their chance of being chosen for a trade. This all helps the terminal operate in a decentralized manner. 

Mainnet staking has yet to launch which will include this as described, but it’s reportedly close. In the meantime you can stake on KuCoin.

____

So I’ve covered the positives. There are some negatives that you should be aware of. First off, when the terminal launched it was at $30 and has fallen off quite a bit since then, even before the dip. This is because a lot of people found the terminal underwhelming because they expected a lot of pairs right out of the gate and there was something like 40 to start out. They’ve been adding new pairs every single week.

It’s also a low marketcap coin and the terminal launched at the end of March, so it’s a new coin and relatively unproven.

CryptoCurrency,Build your own crypto index fund!,"I know a lot of new people are coming into crypto recently and trying to figure out not only what coins to buy, but also how much $ to put in each one.  Not an easy decision for sure.  I want to share a small bit of my take on it and how I personally construct my portfolio.

Index funds in stocks have been wildly popular since Jack Bogle created the first in the 1970s.  There are currently trillions of dollars invested in index funds right now.  More and more money is going into index funds each year as more and more people are realizing they don't know shit about stocks and can't 'beat the market'.  The more research you do, the more you'll realize that even professional fund managers can't beat the market average over the long run.  Take the market average and you'll be very rich thanks to compound interest and steady returns.

So my take on crypto?  Make an index fund and stop acting like you can beat the market average.  Chances are you aren't as smart and savvy as you think.

Since building a true total market index fund would require buying thousands of coins, which obviously isn't possible in crypto, what I suggest is picking 5-12 coins you have fully researched and believe will still exist in 3+ years.  If you don't know, then pick the top 5, top 10, etc.  The market values these coins more for a reason.  These are the 'blue-chip cryptos'.  There is obviously some subjective decisions here which doesn't align with indexing philosophies, but you'll have to do your best.  Hopefully in a few years we'll get a legit crypto index you can easily buy.

Once you know what coins you want to buy, simply take a capitalization weighted index of them.  For example, let's say you want to build a top-5 index - you want to buy BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, and XRP (currently the top 5 excluding stables).  The total market cap of them as I'm typing this is $1212B. BTC is $735B out of the total $1212B.  So you would buy 61% (735/1212) of your money in BTC.  ETH is 27% (324/1212), etc.  And yes you will have the VAST majority of your money in BTC and ETH, because that's how the market values them currently.

One subjective thing I do (besides picking the coins in my index), is I overweight some picks.  For example, I think the market undervalues Ethereum.  So I overweight it.  I hold ADA and DOT as a hedge for ETH, but I don't fucking know how to value them.  So I give them the standard market cap weighting.

Anyways, hope this is helpful or at least provokes some thought for those struggling with how much of each coin to hold.",1621998923,"Build your own crypto index fund!I know a lot of new people are coming into crypto recently and trying to figure out not only what coins to buy, but also how much $ to put in each one.

CryptoCurrency,Sector Analysis of Businesses Utilizing Crypto,"`&lt;h2&gt;General Overview&lt;/h2&gt;`

It is essential for our modern economy to incorporate the usage of cryptocurrencies. In 2020, cryptocurrency ownership significantly increased. As the technology behind cryptocurrencies improves, more businesses will be inclined to receiving payments via crypto as it becomes more efficient. Using cryptocurrencies for business is important for many reasons, such as increased profitability and a wide range of uses. 

`&lt;h2&gt;Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;`

Businesses started accepting payments via crypto a while after its inception. Big brands started accepting cryptocurrency in 2014. These companies are Namecheap, Save the Children, Galactic, and Subway. In 2015, Microsoft, Xbox, Wikipedia, Zynga, ExpressVPN, Big Fish, American Red Cross, and Overstock accepted crypto. In 2016, Badoo, Lionsgate, Rakuten, and G2A accepted crypto. In 2017, Asian Connect, Draft Biden, Bovada, Steam, and Intertops accepted crypto. In 2018, Purism, Peach, Frost Brown Todd, and Hostinger accepted crypto. In 2019, Whole Foods, KFC, BMW, Dish, Nordstrom, and Crate&amp;Barrel accepted crypto. In 2020, Avnet, [takeaway.com](https://takeaway.com), Burger King, Norwegian, Expedia, and AT&amp;T accepted crypto. Finally, 2021 came then [booking.com](https://booking.com), Coca Cola, Starbucks, PayPal, the Water Project, and Twitch used crypto.

`&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;`

By taking a look at the retail industry, 40% of the customers paying with crypto are new customers. Generally, merchants who accept crypto payments saw an average ROI of 327%.

A further analysis can also be made by observing the restaurant industry. One restaurant e-commerce provider named Menufy is allows thousands of restaurants in the US to accept crypto for online food orders. Currently, Menufy accepts crypto payments via Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple, Gemini Dollar, USD coin, Paxos Standard, and Binance USD. 

Looking at the Luxury industry, having cryptocurrencies in use is important since it protects luxury brands from the risk of counterfeit. Luxury brands use this strategy of accepting crypto for limited edition items to create an exclusive experience. 

Another industry we can look at is remittance. The use of crypto in this sector plays an important part in the economy since it is a more effective transfer of money. 15.8% of remitters are even using cryptocurrency for money transfer. Using crypto is 388 times faster and 127 times cheaper than traditional remittance methods. The use of crypto is even being implemented by giving incentives to eaters to earn Lunch Money (LMY) by providing quality reviews. 

Next, we can take a closer look into the gaming industry. In 2020, over 41.9 million gamers owned cryptocurrencies. Amid the increase of ownership of crypto in the gaming industry, the APAC region reported to have the highest crypto ownership rate at 22.6 million gamers. Introducing cryptocurrency in the gaming industry encourages the mass adoption of crypto. Cryptocurrency usage is also important in gaming since it incentivizes players by giving them a vote in the development process. According to Josh Chapman, managing partner of Konvoy Ventures, ""Gaming does not need blockchain; blockchain needs gaming. Blockchain will only see mass adoption and mass application once it provides significant value to the video gaming ecosystem."" Tokenization is already a 40 year old concept in the video game industry, an example being where great success was found trading digital assets in Second Life. 

Endnotes: This is only a small collection of the industries in which crypto is utilized. Other business models and case studies are applicable, but that can be research and discussed later.

CryptoCurrency,DD: Orion Protocol,"Just as a disclaimer, I do own a bit of Orion. It seems to fly a bit under the radar so I figured I would make a post talking about it with some actual research.

——

Orion is a exchange terminal that aggregates purchases from every CEX, DEX, and swap pool in one platform without any KYC. 1inch is similar to Orion, but does not aggregate any CEX. So you can use Binance or Coinbase but not need an account or to verify your identity and share your drivers license and such.

What this means is that if you purchase a coin on Orion, it gets you the best price across every DEX and CEX with the best fees. For example, the other day using Orion to purchase ETH would have saved you roughly $150 as compared to Uniswap due to gas fees. You also get a discount on fees for owning Orion. During the dip last week when people were complaining about issues with centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance ORN continued to aggregate transactions through those exchanges like they weren’t down.

Just last week they launched the BSC bridge which allows users to trade ERC20 coins on the BSC and avoid ETH gas fees altogether. This means that you no longer need to buy these coins on Uniswap and pay $100 in gas fees for your purchase. You can learn more about that [here](http://orionprotocol.io/binancebridge). It’s huge and got lost in all the chaos of the dip.

This is all great, but what about staking? Well ORN staking, when it launches on mainnet soon (currently on KuCoin it’s 22%) is gearing up to be some of the best staking in crypto. Just look at [this calculator](http://calc.orionprotocol.io) to see what I mean. Staking APY is determined by terminal volume, number of coins staked across the network, how long you want to lock them, and Orion price. So if the terminal volume was at 1inch’s volume with 17 million Orion staked (I chose about halfway) and at current price of $8 then you’re seeing 191% APY. If we take the volume to Uniswap volume and it’s ATH of around $30 we see 209% APY

So what your staking does on Orion is two things. You can be a broker or a non-broker. If you’re a broker then you run an Orion Broker Software with accounts across multiple exchanges. This software allows their computers to automatically execute trades routed from the liquidity aggregator via their trading accounts. This is the basis of how the terminal works. Brokers are chosen to execute trades based on how much ORN they stake in the Decentralized Brokerage. Brokers receive a portion of fees from each trade they execute. This is called Delegated Proof of Broker (DPoB)

Now for most people here, you won’t be a broker. You’ll be staking as a non-broker. Non-Broker stakers stake ORN to ‘vote’ for their choice of broker based on the variable reward share offered. Brokers are incentivized to offer attractive rates to non-broker stakers to grow their stake, increasing their chance of being chosen for a trade. This all helps the terminal operate in a decentralized manner. 

Mainnet staking has yet to launch which will include this as described, but it’s reportedly close. In the meantime you can stake on KuCoin.

——

So I’ve covered the positives. There are some negatives that you should be aware of. First off, when the terminal launched it was at $30 and has fallen off quite a bit since then, even before the dip. This is because a lot of people found the terminal underwhelming because they expected a lot of pairs right out of the gate and there was something like 40 to start out. They’ve been adding new pairs every single week.

It’s also a low marketcap coin and the terminal launched at the end of March, so it’s a new coin and relatively unproven.

Fiest, let’s all admire how MATIC remains unstained from hedge fund manipulation/involvement, and is up to nearly $2 already. It’s running separate from BTC/ETH charts. 


Take a look at these incredible projects already taking place on MATIC: https://www.block123.com/en/feature/polygon-matic-network-list/
There are even some better ones in the pipeline. What are gas fees, amiright?


Also, Gamestop just announced that they will be selling second hand games via NFT’s, and they’re actively hiring developers to achieve this on the Ethereum blockchain. https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106071/gaming-retailer-gamestop-is-building-an-nft-platform-on-ethereum


MATIC is a L2 scaling solution for Ethereum, and as you can see in the link above, already supports the NFT space among many other defi projects. I personally think that MATIC’s growth will not only align with ETH, but it’s market cap can grow at a faster rate than that of ETH’s. Scalability is happening now, and it’s bigger than we think. 


Serious players are getting involved, and not just in the finance space. DeFi, ETH, and layering solutions like MATIC will be the tip of the spear regarding defi innovation, and get in sub $2 now for a beautiful long term hold. I personally think it’ll hit $10 soon, which constitutes a market cap of just $100 billion - which is conservative for the defi space imho - especially after the recent Robinhood fiasco.  


Come take a ride with us on this MATICAL school bus.

After doing so, Bitcoin is digitized gold that holds value because people currently decide it does (like all currency) and it doesn't have govt backing yet. The base layer of the code has multiple fundamental issues and is already out of date (10+ years).

Ethereum on the other hand is a keystone (already adopted by multiple large organizations, financial and otherwise) of a decentralized Web3 (the next evolution of the internet).

Overall I am still in positive, but the last couple weeks hit pretty hard, also because I bought the ""dip"" and it then dropped further. I have decided to wait 5 months to see where this is going, and, in case we remain on the levels of today, this is my strategy: if I have 5000$ among all cryptos, I would convert all to ETH, buy 1250$ more in ETH, and with those 6250$, borrow 5000$ DAI (125% collateral). Then sell the 5000$ DAI and put them  in a portfolio with S&amp;P500 etc aiming at 10% ROI.

If ETH goes up I pay the 5% APY on DAI with the 10% returns from the S&amp;P and I go positive.

Of course one possible flaw is the assumption of the 10% returns in the other portfolio, but I think it's safer to assume a 10% ROI on a classic portfolio than leaving everything on crypto.

CryptoCurrency,Where's our Iron Man??,"So, I'm sitting here watching 'Civil War' because I can't remember half the relevant stuff to make sense of 'Falcon and The Winter Soldier' and there's a scene towards the end where Tony finds out that his parents were killed by the Winter Soldier and Captain America knew they were murdered (though he didn't know it was Bucky/tWS). And a thought hit me, ""Where the hell is our Iron Man???""

We have plenty of rich, geeky dudes in crypto. Why isn't Elon or Vitalik making an Iron Man suit? Are they? I think the masses want one!

CryptoCurrency,"It Seems That Before ""The Moon"" We Will Crash Again","In recent days the talk around crypto circles has been the manipulation in the crypto markets. The target has been bitcoin, and the alts have followed bitcoin's slide down. The narrative goes that the whales want to drive bitcoin down to an absurdly suppressed price ($20k - $25k or less) buying the dip before driving the price up. If this is all true, then it seems that we are in for another crash. 

1. Bitcoin has not fallen to $20k-$25k during the most recent crash.
2. Bitcoin is currently trading at about $38k. If it is true that the target is sub $25k, that price target was not consistently reached during the crash, allowing for very narrow buying opportunities.
3. Bitcoin is stalled sub-40K - evidence that the ""whales"" are not yet ready to pump BTC to all-time highs.
4. If it is true that the whales are driving the price down, their tactics have proven very effective. If would stand to reason that they would try again (and perhaps again) to get the price that they really want.

CryptoCurrency,How pump and dump groups work and why you NEED to avoid them,"It seems like the PnD groups are going hard at the moment so I thought I would post this as a refresher on how these groups work, and why **YOU WILL NOT MAKE MONEY** from pump and dump groups.

What people need to realise is that when you become aware of a pump and dump IT IS TOO LATE TO BUY.

The way a successful pump and dump works is this:

1. A very small group of people decide to PnD a coin (typically the leaders of these Discord groups).

2. This group of people buy significant amounts of said coin, usually without moving the price too much.

3. This group creates hype around the coin and convinces people that 'it will be the next to pump' or even give a specific time (which is one of the most ridiculous things to believe anyway).

4. As the hype builds people try to ride the pump, buying at inflated prices. Plenty of pumps have been +100% then hit +500+. This makes people think that buying a token that is up 100% in 10 mins might still work out.

5. The same people who organised the PnD have already started selling their coins. The coins YOU are buying are them selling at the inflated price.

6. By the time the coin hits the top, every single coin from every single person who organised it has been sold... to you.

7. You're left with bags, desperately selling while the price tanks.

8. Oh what's this? The price has started to climb again! This is due to other bag holders desperately creating hype so they can get out with smaller losses.

9. Oh the price is dumping even harder now and you got greedy. You've now lost even more and not even to the original organisers. They're long gone.

So please remember, if you know of a pump and dump you have long missed the boat.",1621988670,"How pump and dump groups work and why you NEED to avoid themIt seems like the PnD groups are going hard at the moment so I thought I would post this as a refresher on how these groups work, and why **YOU WILL NOT MAKE MONEY** from pump and dump groups.

CryptoCurrency,My take on crypto,"I think of different crypto coins representing things that are in the real world.

A small company’s stock is their coin, like NU is a VPN business or Sushi Swap is a stock exchange

ETH, ADA, SOL are large to small cities, they say come do business here in the city and work with all the other companies, bragging about their infrastructure and low taxes

some coins like BTC are Assets like Gold, could u trade a small gold bar with someone for a pretzel? sure but you probably will hold it because its your safety net vs inflation

some are trying to be the new world currency.. thats a hard sell but good luck Doge and CGLD

CryptoCurrency,"""Will it only be one coin in the end?"" is a weird question that I keep seeing and here is why that will never happen.","When we invest in a bunch of coins and tokens, it's not like it will end up being one. Cryptocurrencies are not the same as national currencies, there is not a very limited space where one coin rules them all. 

Crypto/blockchain is in many ways like the internet, in that it provides a multitute of possibilities. To take a couple of examples:

1. Sending/transferring money across borders

This is a typical way that some cryptos can be used and are being used. There are tons of ways to do this, but crypto is just a better way to do it. So the best money-transferring companies base this on a crypto currency. There will always be several of these competing, trying to outdo each other (just like normal competitive landscapes in Business). There will never be one, always many. 

2. Tokens

Again, crypto can be seen as a way to handle valuable assets in a much better, faster way than before. It allows a company with a browser, a game, search engine or whatever you like to create value through a coin/token and engage or pay people. This value is often tied to the operation of that company, wheter it's running a browser, a community or anything else. 

The point is, there will most likely be a ton of products and services that has a coin or token associated with them. You ask if there will be one? I ask how many good ones will there be?",1621988051,"""Will it only be one coin in the end?"" is a weird question that I keep seeing and here is why that will never happen.When we invest in a bunch of coins and tokens, it's not like it will end up being one.

Good Security Practices:

1.) It's always a good idea to have a email dedicated to crypto, so its not an email that's linked to a bunch of websites

2.) Don't reuse passwords / weak passwords

3.) Use a password manager

* HaveIbeenPwned is a website created by Troy Hunt who is well known within the security field that keeps track of data breaches, what info was collected, and what emails were affected

Story Time: A user on here made a post about how he got hacked, I decided to help him figure out the root cause by asking him a series of questions (I work as a security analyst and work Detect and Response / security investigations) Turns out his email was part of a data breach from a crypto site (Similar to the Gatehub I was part of (pic below)) He re-used that password for an exchange he was using and didn't have 2FA activated.

HaveIBeenPwned allows you to sign up for notifications for when a new breach is discovered

CryptoCurrency,"Reasoning about Bytecoin, have thoughts?","Hello Redditors!

I want to tell you a little about the history of anonymous cryptocurrencies. It all started in 2011, I can't say the exact date. A certain circle of people was inspired by the appearance of Bitcoin, but they were not satisfied with the fact that all transactions were open, and anyone could walk along the chain and track the path. The private cryptocurrency Bytecoin was written using the CryptoNote application layer protocol. A hundred forks of other cryptocurrencies were created, which are now more successful and possibly better. But, like Bitcoin, Bytecoin is a unique original.

On July 4, 2012, the system was launched. The contact person 6H7QV3LK55m was responsible and the main one who oversaw the project.

You can flip the entire internet, look into the darkest corners of the web. But you will never find the truth and the real people who stood and are behind this project. Only aliases and anonyms. Perhaps this is good, the regulatory authorities of the state will not be able to influence the development team.

Bytecoin is often credited with the fame that this project was a scam. I believe that every cryptocurrency created initially has the goal of making owners rich. And then only benefit the world. Even Bitcoin has a big premine, Satoshi Nakamoto has millions of Bitcoins, and he has truly become one of the richest holders.

In 2016, Bytecoin was inactive for a long time. And in August 2017, a “new” team came in, rebranding, releasing a new roadmap, new plans and new listings on exchanges. In 2018, Bytecoin was added to Binance, it was the most high-profile event in the world of cryptocurrencies. At the moment, the Bytecoin price jumped to 10,000 SAT (at that time it was $ 0.98 for 1 BCN), but then fell, and was in the range of $ 0.20. In the same year, in the fall, Bytecoin was excluded from the Binance lists. And the price of Bytecoin began to decline sharply. After that, the Bytecoin team went into the shadows and for two years it was silent, was inactive. And not so long ago, they got in touch and fixed the problems with the web wallet. And a little more than a month are silent again.

Since August 2017, I have worked and helped them develop the project, they did not pay me, I did it on my own enthusiasm. Unfortunately, I was unable to dump my coins on Binance in 2018. But later I sold everything I had anyway. So I am writing this as an independent person.

I believe that the official group of persons is again preparing something interesting, but for their own benefit in the first place.

The liquidity in this coin is small, and it is possible with a little effort to produce a planned pump up to 2-5 cents. Perhaps this will upset and disrupt the plans of those people who are behind this project. So far I have bought 1,200,000 coins, at an average price of $ 0.0006.

CryptoCurrency,"A beginner's take on the issue of diversification in Crypto, which cryptos to invest in and which ones to ignore.","I have recently read posts on diversification in crypto and what to do with altcoins in a bear market on this sub, which led me to look into good crypto options that I haven't paid attention to. I am having a hard time wrapping my head around how many cryptocurrencies are out there with similar products and goals, mostly in the decentralized finance space. 

A little background, I started investing in ETH this January when I learned about its ability to be used as a platform for building applications on top of it. I kept finding all these other cryptocurrencies that do the same thing ETH claims to do but these other options claim to do it better than ETH. I believe in the potential of blockchain, so I don't want to miss out on the next bitcoin.  

Soon after I started investing, I found out about Cardano, then I found algorand and started investing in it because of its MIT origins. Then I found out that Solana has even better network speed and whatnot, so invested a little in that too. 

Fast forward to today, I am looking at ADA, ALGO, SOL, DOT, XTZ to name a few all of which seem to be competing with the OG that is ETH and with each other. Then there are others such as IOTA, ATOM, EOS, ERGO. I am not even sure if they belong to the same category as other supposed ETH killers, as I have very limited knowledge. 

Needless to say, I am overwhelmed by all the options that are available and I intend to learn more about each one of these. But even if I do, there is no way for anyone to predict which one of these cryptocurrencies will be in existence and will grow their values in the next 10 or 20 years. I have thought about splitting my already very small investment into smaller chunks and investing equally in 10 options but I am interested in how other people feel about all this. 

Are you content with investing only in ETH? Do you invest in altcoins too but only invest in the ones you know most about? If so, aren't you afraid of losing it all by betting on the wrong horse? How would you rank all the different options and what criteria would you use for this ranking?

I made a post about it in their subreddit and had people telling me to f off, messages to kill myself, I shouldn't be in crypto, etc... which was another red flag for a mere bit of criticism. 

Be wary of posting anything that can be hinted as something negative otherwise you'll have to endure the ""safemoom army"" on their subreddit.  

I started looking at more users that made content in that subreddit and noticed 90% of the accounts were created in the last month. Another red flag. 

Something super fishy is going on over there. I'm beginning to think it's an elaborate scam. I hope I'm wrong and people aren't left holding the bag (myself included) but I'm starting to smell a scam.",1005,40,965

CryptoCurrency,Koinly bulk categorizing of transactions," I am wondering how to mark deposits and withdraws as a transfer without having all the wallets.

What I have done is imported my full trade history, for every crypto exchange that I use, I have a history of everything on what I bought it at and sold it at. But I am having issues as to where coins were sent as far as other wallets, as I do not have records of every wallet I have anymore. I tried importing the wallets I have now but it never works as there is missing history and koinly can't match any transactions. It may help automate this a little if it could match stuff sent back in from a different wallet months later, but it looks like it only does this if the transaction is within 24 hours. Otherwise it markets it as a deposit or withdraw. I have so many transactions that it isn't realistic to manually look for a matching amount. On top of the some coins where split, merged, and commingled between other wallets. I am also missing some of the wallet addresses I previously had so there is no way for me to rebuild where my coins moved too.

This from what I understand means individual per wallet cost basis are impossible to do. As when I deposit a coin into an exchange there is no way to know which coin is disposed or which one was transferred from what exchange, due to incomplete records, and coins commingling. I don't have the full transfer history for everything. What I do have is a full history of buy and sell history on each exchange.

So I am thinking that my only option is to do Universal tracking but I am having problems doing this on Koinly, does anyone know if there is a way to ignore all deposits and withdraws and just mark them as transfer?",1621981120,"Koinly bulk categorizing of transactions I am wondering how to mark deposits and withdraws as a transfer without having all the wallets.

I've been wanting to get into crypto for a while; and have been studying charts, reading white papers, and trying to learn as much as I can. I have learned a lot here about what to do and what not to do.

I was able to get into several coins this past week at what I thought were fair entry points. 90% of what I invested are coins that I'll be hodling as they seem like solid projects that have a lot of potential.

That leaves the other 10% for what I think of as my gambling money - taking bets on coins and/or doing more active trading. I look at this portion of my crypto allocation like the money I would use to drop on a NFL o/u or something like that. I'll probably lose more than I'll win, but it's definitely more active and fun. 

My question is how do y'all pick coins for more speculative trades (or do you do this kind of trading at all)?
My initial strategy is to look for coins that are more volatile and/or have fairly large difference between the 1-day and 7-day % changes. Then I try to get in at a dip and hold until it goes up enough to make a little profit.
Does anyone else do something similar? Or am I way off base?

I know this probably isn't a viable long-term strategy, but it's something to do with a small part of my crypto budget while I watch my other coins go (eventually) up. 

Thanks for any comments/suggestions.",1621980874,"Looking for advice on picking coins for short-term investing.First of all, I'd like to say thanks to the community here.

CryptoCurrency,A truly Stable Coin (evading inflation),"Commodity- based stablecoin

Are there any (or is it even possible to have) a commodity-based stablecoin? I am intrigued by the idea of a stablecoin that would be tethered to the value of something that every person needs. Perhaps attached to the value of a simple grain like rice, gallon of gas, wattage of electricity or price of land. 
It would be freeing and secure to have a coin that would forever be worth the price of a loaf of bread, or a kg or rice (for instance). You may not ever buy the underlying resource with said coin, but you can be quite sure that your currency would hold its value within the ebb and flow of value if the underlying commodity. Maybe it would not be one commodity that it is tethered to, but a ‘basket’ of commodities like we analyze inflation.
It would obviously not be an investment, but rather a way to secure your money. It would be especially helpful in countries with extreme inflation.",1621980584,"A truly Stable Coin (evading inflation)Commodity- based stablecoin

CryptoCurrency,[SERIOUS] I’m considering selling my $7500 car (Chevrolet Cruze 2012) to buy Etheruem.,"Please hear out my reason and plan.

First of all the car costed me around $13000 and so far I’ve paid $7500 which is my profit that I’m counting on. My plan is to sell it to either a company or private (whichever) then pay the rest and use the profit to buy Ethereum coins.

Anyway my reason for doing so is so that by  either January or April of 2022, I can afford a student’s loan for my pilot course. I am more confident than scared because of its famous near-future-rise prediction which is around $10000 to $20000 by November. 

I am considering doing so also because at the moment I have a couple of responsibilities that don’t allow me to save enough money for my course in a decent time, at least not until after 5 years or so which I personally cannot accept for a couple personal reasons. For those who would recommend the free course through military, I’ve tried that and unfortunately I don’t meet their special requirements and I also don’t like the path they put students through to become a commercial or airline pilot.

I am confident this might work but not 100% which is why I’d like to hear what this community has to say in my decision making.",1621980544,"[SERIOUS] I’m considering selling my $7500 car (Chevrolet Cruze 2012) to buy Etheruem.Please hear out my reason and plan.

CryptoCurrency,About the bear market,"I got into crypto months ago and have been learning ever since. I learned about the 2017/2018 bear market and all so I was wondering. When do you know we're in a bear market? How big does the crash need to be? What do the veterans think the price of bitcoin and Eth will be in the bear market? I'm just trying to learn and to make plans for accumalating.
I know that the bull run might not be over but it could also be a bear trap. What coins should i move all my funds to if that were the case? Stable coins maybe? Or fiat?

CryptoCurrency,Newbie questions here,"Hello. First of all, I'm learning so much from y'all. So thanks so much!

I'm having trouble learning about a couple of very basic things. So I hope you don't mind that I ask here.

First question is regarding fiat money. When someone says I wish I had more fiat money. Are they just saying I wish I had more money (dollars) in my savings or money set aside so they can be ready to invest? Why would someone put their existing money into their wallet under Fiat money? Just so it's conveniently there and ready for purchases? 

A question about trading. Some people have posted that you don't lose money if you don't sell. I'm not really sure I understand this. Let's say you purchased Doge (I did not). Does that mean you take that investment out and use it to purchase Bitcoin with that amount? And the difference is selling completely and taking the money completely back?

I guess that's all I have for now! I'm considering staking soon but I want to read more before I ask about that. Thanks alot!",1621978434,"Newbie questions hereHello. First of all, I'm learning so much from y'all. So thanks so much!

CryptoCurrency,Noob Question on Staking,"Hi all,

New to crypto investing and the concept of staking. 

Simple question here, but wanted to make sure I get it right: depending on the currencies you own (and which allow staking) it seems you need to have several different wallets to stack most of your coins. I have seen several wallets which offer the ability to stack, A, B and C coins, but not D, E or F coins. However wallet two seems to offer A, D and F coins, but not B,C and G coins....etc. 

Is this view correct? Do many of you who stack use several different wallets to accomplish it? I saw this nice post from a few days ago but was not sure I got it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mzgmlg/guide\_to\_staking\_proofofstake\_coins/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mzgmlg/guide_to_staking_proofofstake_coins/)

CryptoCurrency,Has BTC's continued market dominance endangered the vision of a decentralized currency market?,"The title is in no way inferring that BTC is centralized. However, if China or Elon Musk can manipulate the entire crypto market with a Tweet about BTC, doesn't that indicate that BTC has too much control over the rest of the crypto market?

We also have to consider what happened this past weekend, in which there are indicators that some banking institutions were able to dip the market through massive BTC sellouts. While this isn't officially centralization, it is a form of it, if one asset controls all the others.

We all know this is a problem. We don't want to admit that BTC's purpose has run its course, and it's now time to start funding better technology use cases, like ETH, ADA, MATIC, etc.

If we are truly interested in use cases, with making money taking a backseat to how blockchain technologies can and are changing the world, maybe it's time to back that up with actions. It's been said that BTC's use case now is for storing wealth. If that's the case, then it has outlived its usefulness.

We have to admit that banks and governments are now taking crypto seriously. And with a lack of regulation, crypto markets are massively susceptible to manipulation... and they absolutely will manipulate the markets. Once that happens, and it will, the SEC will *gladly* step in and ""help,"" possibly leading to actual centralization and most certainly higher taxes and other regulations.

CryptoCurrency,"We're in a Crab Market, how you see people act, that's the direction Cryptos are going!","#What is a Crab Market?

A Sideways Marker or as some have started calling it, a ""Crab Market"" is similar to a bull or bear market except that instead of going up or down it goes sideways. 

Many of us expect the price to go up and some of us expecte
it to go down. When crypto investors can decide if they're paying too much or too little for Bitcoin, Ethereum, XLM.. the price can potentially stall, this my newbie friend, is a sideways market.  

This is important to know because at any moment people might decide to continue with the bull market meaning right now it could be a good time to buy before it rises. 

The past 24 hours have in my opinion been a good example of what a Crab Market looks like. The price has been pretty much static with BTC oscillating between 35k and 38k, which for Bitcoin is as still as it gets. 


#Are we in a Crab Market?


In my nonprofessional opinion, this could be the *calm before the storm.*

 I've already upped my position and am thinking of adding more capital into it, because once the average Joe realizes there's money to be made and potentially turning 1k into 10k quickly, they'll flood the market inflating the price even more.

#But, how can I benefit from this ""Crab Market""?

Good question! A Crab Market removes most uncertainty in the price. You can count on the fact that the price is currently presenting resistance at $35-39k so you might want to buy at that range and then wait for it to rise to $50k and sell for some profit, *OR* You could also buy @$40k and HODL to the moon knowing that the price will likely stay at $46k+ for the following hours/days.

#Tl;dr 

The Crab Market seems to be the calm before the craziest bull market that's to come!

The sideways graph is a perfect entry point for anyone interested in buying more before the market *potentially* bulls to the moon.

I wouldn't expect high amounts of traffic but it's something I would like to do - partly because I think retail adoption of Crypto will be what pushes it into mainstream use.

So what would be your choose and why? (And not a hypothetical in the future X will be best, but what is *actually* best for use today).

Efficient tech with low (to no) fees doesn't mean much of no one is using that coin either as it wouldn't be that appealing, and although Bitcoin and ETH are the most popular, they are also known for high transaction fees. 

Would they just be too expensive to use? Or do I just bite the bullet and go for something like BTC/ETH anyway due to their popularity?

CryptoCurrency,What would you say to someone who made millions by being early on SafeMoon?,"So many people call this and similar tokens scams...BUT:

I have made 5M$(yes , sold a few weeks ago)by putting in 100$ in very early March. 
I'll have 3M$ after taxes. I still have 500K$ in to ride to the moon.

I also put in 100$ into Shib around that time. As well as Feg.
My Shib is now worth almost 100K. Even in this dip. Was 400K at ATH. Still holding.
My Feg is worth 10K$. Still holding.

I started in Crypto this February. I initially bought the good coins like VET, ADA , RSR, ENJ and INJ.

But you know something? If I had not found out about these so called low market cap shit coins from Telegram and Reddit...I would not be a millionaire under 25. And if I had held on to those good coins? I'd have maybe a couple of hundred bucks more. Maybe a thousand. 

People say that you should invest what you are willing to lose even for the good projects like ADA and VET....but if you are willing to lose your investment, why not go with something THAT ACTUALLY HAS A CHANCE TO 1000X(by looking at it's Market Cap)?


As a side note, I want to grow my money safely now. So I am thinking of selling a quarter of my Shib(25K) and putting 1000$ into 15 projects that have VERY low market cap.

I have made 5M$(yes , sold a few weeks ago)by putting in 100$ in very early March. 
I'll have 3M$ after taxes. I still have 500K$ in to ride to the moon.

I also put in 100$ into Shib around that time. As well as Feg.
My Shib is now worth almost 100K. Even in this dip. Was 400K at ATH. Still holding.
My Feg is worth 10K$. Still holding.

I started in Crypto this February. I initially bought the good coins like VET, ADA , RSR, ENJ and INJ.

But you know something? If I had not found out about these so called low market cap shit coins from Telegram and Reddit...I would not be a millionaire under 25. And if I had held on to those good coins? I'd have maybe a couple of hundred bucks more. Maybe a thousand. 

People say that you should invest what you are willing to lose even for the good projects like ADA and VET....but if you are willing to lose your investment, why not go with something THAT ACTUALLY HAS A CHANCE TO 1000X(by looking at it's Market Cap)?


As a side note, I want to grow my money safely now. So I am thinking of selling a quarter of my Shib(25K) and putting 1000$ into 15 projects that have VERY low market cap. Shill me your best ""real use case"" projects with very low MC. I will also put 10K into a LEGIT(aka something this sub doesn't think is a scam) project with MC  under 5 million.

Will there still be a centralised bank where you can get approved for a loan, and where other people can store their crypto for interest?

And if that's the case, how will the government react in case of a crisis like 2008? Because money will be decentralised, they can't print money like they did back then. 

My question mostly though is, how will this problem be solved? People will need loans, but loans bring risk and the government won't have a way to solve a potential financial crisis. Or will the world of decentralised finance not have room for mortgages?

CryptoCurrency,Poll: Should There Be A 5 Minute Time Limit In Between Making Posts/Comments?,"If you've been in this sub ever since they introduced Moons, you will have noticed the amount of spamming and low quality posts/comments there are. There have been attempts to improve the quality of content, however, I think the biggest issue of moon farmers has yet to be addressed.

For this reason, I believe there should be a 5 minute time limit between making posts/comments. What this means is that if you comment on a thread, you will have to wait 5 minutes before being able to comment on a separate thread. 

I believe this is a simple implementation that won't completely resolve the moon farming issue, however, it is definitely a great first step. 

Ideally, this implementation would have the following benefits:

* It would restrict the amount of low quality/effort comments on new posts. If you look at new posts, half the time you will see the same usernames providing worthless/obvious comments that does no one any good.
* It should improve community engagement and quality posts/comments. Rather than spamming comments on new posts, users should draft appropriate and valuable responses since they will have to wait 5 minutes.
* It should semi increase the value of Moons as there should be less moon farming and more quality content.

Based on previous discussions with community members on this topic, I do believe there should be a few exceptions to this 5 minute time limit:

* Making comments on your own post
* Making comments on your own comment
* Making comments on other people's comments within the same post that you already commented on

In the end, this 5 minute time limit suggestion should not affect most users. If you take the time to read a post thoroughly and draft a valuable response and proofread it, you should already be taking around 5 minutes. If you are commenting every minute of the hour, I would highly question the value you are providing in your comments.

Lastly, I plan on sending this proposal to the moderators of this sub after gauging the feedback and responses I get to this post. So, whether you agree or you don't agree, please let me know as all feedback is appreciated!

CryptoCurrency,Reflections of a Crypto Idiot," I first bought Bitcoin is 2014 to buy  e-cigarette nicotine liquid from an online vendor that wouldn’t accept  my billing address but did accept Bitcoin. I bought $70 worth (BTC was  599 at the time), made my purchase, and was left with 0.001 BTC in my  account.

In 2017, that 0.001 BTC was now worth more than my entire original purchase. At that point, I became interested.

Coinbase  was my initial on-ramp. It only listed three coins at the time, BTC,  ETH, and LTC. I would buy whichever coin would transfer the quickest,  and send it over to Binance to buy whatever ridiculous coin was  currently popular on Reddit. I went through them all. Most of them are  gone. Maybe nostalgically remembered. Maybe not.

By the time the Bear rolled around. I was mainly consolidated into ETH and NANO.

During this time, I avoided two disasters by dumb luck only.

I,  as one did at the time, bought my Raiblocks (NANO) from Bitgrail.  Luckily, even then, everyone was always pushing, “not your keys, not  your coins”. I must have pulled my coins out only weeks before that  whole thing went down.

I also used  QuadrigaCX as an on-ramp. Same Deal. Luckily my coins were off the  exchange before the owner died, or faked his death, or whatever, and  took the keys to the exchange wallets with him.

Either  way, soon, my thousands of dollars invested were worth only hundreds. I  tried to forget about crypto. My lambo dreams had come to an end. I  wasn’t going to become independently wealthy. McAfee would have to eat  his own dick on live TV.

I stopped  visiting the sub as regularly. I didn’t check coin prices. I didn’t log  into exchanges. In the back of my mind, there was only the faintest  glimmer of hope that my coins would ever be worth anything.

Then  2021 happened. I started to hear news again. I started visiting the sub  again. I found my old phone to get my google authenticator and access  the exchanges again.

As the prices kept rising, I moved my coins to an exchange so I could sell if it seemed like a good time.

Ultimately, a couple of weeks ago, I did.

I paid of some debt.

I can’t retire, but I can sleep a bit better at night. I can’t drive a lambo to the moon or anything, but it’s still good.

I hope to buy back in again in the future. Do it better. Make better choices maybe. See what happens.

CryptoCurrency,"Which do you have faith in, Amazon or the entire crypto market?","I was listening to the radio today and a story came on about Amazon closing in on the purchase of MGM.  In the discussion they mentioned that Amazon is currently valued at just over $1.6 Trillion.  Immediately it occurred to me that this is very close to the current market cap of the entire crypto market.  When I got back to my computer I checked on coinmarketcap and also googled an Amazon stock quote.  Not only are these 2 close, they're almost identical.  $1.63T total crypto market cap versus $1.64T Amazon market cap as of the writing of this post.

Now, what value is this information?  Obviously coin market caps and a company's market cap are different things.  Amazon's stock represents a real world business that publishes earnings and has a business growth plan that investors believe in.  The market cap in crypto is a little more nebulous, and I have argued in other posts it is more akin to valuing a commodity than a stock because it is really driven by supply and demand for the specific item you are investing in, not in a broader business plan or expected revenue.  Despite that, market caps do still mean one very specific thing.  They always refer to a perceived value of a commodity, security or currency.

With this in mind, I asked myself to do a thought experiment.  Imagine a world 5 or 10 years from now (my investment horizon is longer than this and if you're 40 or under yours is likely much longer than this too).  In that world, which will be more valuable?  The Amazon corporation or the cryptocurrency market?

First, I have to ask who uses Amazon currently?

The answer here is damn near everybody in the US.  A quick Google search shows that somewhere between 60-82% of US households either hold or have access to through a close friend/family member an Amazon Prime membership (depending on which source you use).  82%.  Think about that for a minute.  What other thing do you know of that 82% of people have?  There aren't many things outside of necessities.  By comparison as of 2018, only 85% of households had broadband internet access.

It's safe to say that in the US at least, Amazon is ubiquitous.  It would be hard for them to capture more market share than they already have at this point.  Their primary growth in the US will be through increasing prices and reducing costs.  They have already won in terms of customer acquisition.  In fact, customer retention could become a bigger focus going forward which is probably where they are going to be spending money in the US, rather than acquisition.

I live in the US so I don't know a ton about their global reach, but a quick Google search shows that there are 150 million subscribers to Amazon plus in Europe already as well.  This doesn't seem like a market they will be able to grow significantly in either.  For reference the population of Europe is \~750 million, so that's 20%.  In the US, the number of subscribers is about 33% of the population and the estimates I see suggest that this number of subscriptions means they are in \~82% of households.  Using this math, at absolute best they might be able to double their penetration into Europe, but even that is a stretch.

Asia is a mixed bag.  Japan is already heavily saturated as well, China will be difficult to penetrate fully and India is growing for them, in fact it may be one of their best growth opportunities in the next 5 to 10 years.

Overall though, it's hard to imagine them increasing their customer base by a huge amount in the next 5 to 10 years.  Their growth will primarily come from increasing monetization of their existing customer base and they've got competition coming from traditional retailers and newcomers alike.

Next, I asked myself who uses cryptocurrency currently?

The answer here is that it's still pretty limited.  We saw a survey posted on this site a couple of weeks ago that suggested that 46 million people in the US own Bitcoin and not a single person I saw respond to the article actually believed it.  You can search for the article if you want, but there were a number of flaws with their methodology, not the least of which they only interviewed households with &gt;$50k in income.  At any rate, even if we believe their numbers, excluding children, that would only be 22% of the population.

Looking at the rest of the world is a bit trickier, but I found a report on the Chainalysis blog that suggests there are only 5 countries in the world (Ukraine, Russia, Venezuela, China and Kenya) with more per capita crypto activity than the US.  I think it's safe to say that worldwide adoption is well under 20%.

For me, this is what it's all about.  The crypto market is severely under-capitalized currently.  Most people are still not invested in it and the growth potential is enormous compared to something like Amazon despite them being held for identical value today.  The reality is that in 5 to 10 years, there is no doubt in my mind &gt;50% of people in the US will own crypto and more institutions will be piling in.  Worldwide adoption should follow similar trends.  Looking at it from this angle, it's impossible to imagine that the market cap of the crypto market won't grow several times between now and then.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying there's no risk in this space.  Individual coins will win and lose, there will be bear markets along the way, but let's say you're investing today even it what may be the final stages of a bull market (not saying it is or isn't, just that it might be), if your investment horizon is 5 to 10 years out or more, there is no doubt in my mind that crypto is the place to put that money.

I live in the US so I don't know a ton about their global reach, but a quick Google search shows that there are 150 million subscribers to Amazon plus in Europe already as well.  This doesn't seem like a market they will be able to grow significantly in either.  For reference the population of Europe is \~750 million, so that's 20%.  In the US, the number of subscribers is about 33% of the population and the estimates I see suggest that this number of subscriptions means they are in \~82% of households.  Using this math, at absolute best they might be able to double their penetration into Europe, but even that is a stretch.

Asia is a mixed bag.  Japan is already heavily saturated as well, China will be difficult to penetrate fully and India is growing for them, in fact it may be one of their best growth opportunities in the next 5 to 10 years.

Overall though, it's hard to imagine them increasing their customer base by a huge amount in the next 5 to 10 years.  Their growth will primarily come from increasing monetization of their existing customer base and they've got competition coming from traditional retailers and newcomers alike.

Next, I asked myself who uses cryptocurrency currently?

The answer here is that it's still pretty limited.  We saw a survey posted on this site a couple of weeks ago that suggested that 46 million people in the US own Bitcoin and not a single person I saw respond to the article actually believed it.  You can search for the article if you want, but there were a number of flaws with their methodology, not the least of which they only interviewed households with &gt;$50k in income.  At any rate, even if we believe their numbers, excluding children, that would only be 22% of the population.

Looking at the rest of the world is a bit trickier, but I found a report on the Chainalysis blog that suggests there are only 5 countries in the world (Ukraine, Russia, Venezuela, China and Kenya) with more per capita crypto activity than the US.  I think it's safe to say that worldwide adoption is well under 20%.

For me, this is what it's all about.  The crypto market is severely under-capitalized currently.  Most people are still not invested in it and the growth potential is enormous compared to something like Amazon despite them being held for identical value today.  The reality is that in 5 to 10 years, there is no doubt in my mind &gt;50% of people in the US will own crypto and more institutions will be piling in.  Worldwide adoption should follow similar trends.  Looking at it from this angle, it's impossible to imagine that the market cap of the crypto market won't grow several times between now and then.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying there's no risk in this space.  Individual coins will win and lose, there will be bear markets along the way, but let's say you're investing today even it what may be the final stages of a bull market (not saying it is or isn't, just that it might be), if your investment horizon is 5 to 10 years out or more, there is no doubt in my mind that crypto is the place to put that money.

1) Majority  of the alt coins are highly coorelated with the values of BTC and ETH. These alt coins are in their infancy stage and it will take time for us to see them following their indepent trends. 

2)Basic golden rule of investing - DON'T invest more than which u can afford to lose. Yes I suffered losses and also yes I'm back at break even just because I had the power to hold since I invested a proportion of my savings which I most definitely don't have a need for right now. 

3)Any currency with a strong growth prospect should be bought with the intention of holding it for the long run. This goes for all markets including stocks

4)The extreme volatility in the market was mainly due to the paper hands pussying out and making the whales even richer

5)Any news related to the implementation of sustainable mining is bound to put these currencies on the path to the moon again

6)As u can easily identify by now, most of the market dynamics are based on speculation, for example tweets by Elon or announcement of regulatory measures by the leading world Economies like China and US

7)Trust your instincts if they are strong. I told a friend to cash out his etherium when it reached $4.2k so that he may buy more before the ""expected market dip"" two days later after giving this advice to my friend, the market did crash because the bubble could be identified by anyone having a mediocre understanding of market trends. So yes despite the fact that very few of us are experts, it's always better to trust your instincts and make calculated risks. 

8)When/if things get too stressful, just forget about the markets and whichever platform you're using. Take this time to gather your emotions and focus on other aspects of your life and the markets would be correcting themselves in the background because LONG TERM baby. 

9)Many people are saying 2017 was the best time to buy but eyo wasn't 2007 an even better time to buy when bitcoin was just gaining popularity. So yes it will always be the right time to buy because these decentralized currencies are the future of the financial markets. 

10)Don't be lazy of you want to invest. I have been following the crypto craze for the past 2 years now and the only reason why I did not invest in it due to the lacking ease of access to these markets in my country.

**TL;DR: If you have a stablecoin balance of $10,000 or higher this card is better than a 2% cashback card, regardless of your spend.** Strangely, the MORE you spend, the less of a better deal it is, ultimately capping out at only being $50 more per year than using a 2% cashback card. **If you don't have that stablecoin balance, the card earns you about $150 less per year than a cashback card.** Of course this pays in BTC and stablecoin, not fiat, and that might be a consideration (but you could also just use your fiat cashback to buy crypto).

# Steps

Like ev'ry flower wilts, like youth is fading and turns to age, so also one's achieving: Each virtue and each wisdom needs parading in one's own time, and must not last forever.

CryptoCurrency,"Questions - Hardware wallet, Uniswap and Coin retention","Hello,

I have a quick couple of questions:

1. I am looking at buying a hardware wallet - After quick research I keep seeing the names ledger s/x echoed. From an outside perspective this seems to do the trick, however, I am curious about hardware failure and how this effects the recovery.  

   1. For example - Let's say I have 40,000,000 Bitcoin and I want to hold on to them for 5 years. During this time the drive fails for what ever reason. Are the coins lost/recoverable?
   2. I see that there is a limitation of how many coins can be held on the Ledger S. Does this mean if you have, from the previous example, 40 million coins that it could not hold/store the information to keep it? Or is the limited coins in regards to the amount of different coins i.e. Bitcoin, ETH, DOGE,  etc. regardless of the amount held in each coin?
2. If you purchase coins through a CEX like Binance or Coinbase and store it in a digital wallet, for this example Coinbase wallet, can you move this to a hardware wallet at any time or is it locked into their wallet only to be exchanged through their trading platform?
3. I also understand using Uniswap is the way to purchase them. Is this as easy as buying ETH, visiting Uniswap and exchanging them for SHIBA and then holding them in the hardware or Coinbase wallet? And lets say years later, you want to trade back out, it would be as easy as loading the hardware/coinbase wallet and trading as long as there was demand for it?

Any information will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1621967977,"Questions - Hardware wallet, Uniswap and Coin retentionHello,

CryptoCurrency,Thoughts on Market Cap,"Looking to get people’s thoughts on whether Market Cap is a good gauge of value and a future price prediction.

Here’s my thoughts, but I’m not in the stocks game...

Market Cap is the value of a company if all the shares are added together at the current market price, right?

Cryptocurrency and blockchain is not necessarily attributed to a single ‘company’ and therefore may accumulate value by being valuable to many companies together.

A way I try and describe my interest and investment in Ethereum, for example, is to think of it as the underlying infrastructure that will power the next layer of the internet. If someone was to suggest there was an ability to buy shares in ‘the internet’ back in 95 and by doing so, you could charge others to use it, it would essentially mean that pretty much everything we do today would be revenue generating for those with a ‘stake’.

CryptoCurrency,Why Serum (SRM) is an amazing investment right now,"After the last market crash, which happened amid news about regulation from China and an artificial dump from Elon Musk, there was a large influx of cryptocurrency to Coinbase Pro wallets. Unlike the Chinese market, the American market is still loyal to cryptocurrencies. On May 24th, an overhyped token, Solana (SOL) was added to the Coinbase Pro platform. However, despite the ""hype"" around other cryptocurrencies like SHIBA INU and SAFEMOON, Solana's ""hype"" has technical reasons behind it. At the moment, the Solana blockchain is one of, if not the best blockchain smart contract on the market. With the addition of SOL coin to Coinbase Pro and the hype around cryptocurrency, Solana will quickly enter the masses. The Solana ecosystem will begin to develop very quickly and be enriched with new tokens from other projects created or wrapped on the Solana blockchain. One of the advantages of the Solana blockchain is its complete loyalty and ease of writing DeFi protocols on it. Currently, until the full deployment of the Cardano network, the Solana blockchain is the best for DeFi – protocols. After the last market crash, a large number of hedge funds expressed their interest in the DeFi tokens of the sector. Such interest will once again reinvigorate DeFI, as it happened a year earlier, when the DeFI sector began to interest the masses. The growth of BNB that occurred a couple of months ago was primarily associated with the high ETH commission in DeFI protocols, and it is for this reason that the volume of blocked funds in PancakeSwap which are on BSC has greatly increased, overtaking its competitors, and coming out on the first line in terms of TVL volume. However, the commission on the BSC network, the network bandwidth, the latest news on Binance audits and the thoughts of investors about the pseudo-centralization of BSC by the Binance team, are the reasons tokenization cannon be fully realized on BSC. Even after Uniswap V3 update, which happened in an attempt to maintain technical competition with projects such as SushiSwap, PancakeSwap and Curve, the platform wasn’t able to reach the level of the protocols that it’s competing with. Why is Serum token the most promising on the market for medium-term investments? The release of the Solana blockchain platform to the masses in such a short period of time contributes to the emergence of new projects and tokens working on the Solana blockchain. The most convenient way of all on the market for direct swap of tokens on the Solana ecosystem is the Serum platform. Unlike other DEXs on the market, there are no centralized vulnerabilities in the Serum platform, which instills fear in users of other DEX platforms. In addition to supporting tokens on Solana, Serum fully supports ERC20 tokens on ETH. Serum staking is one of the best stakes to deal with centralization. To be eligible for Serum staking (SRM), a staking node needs to have 10 million SRM and one MegaSerum (MSRM) staked (1MSRM=1 million SRM). The Serum price on ATH at $12.89 did not make a large number of hodlers sell the asset, which indicates that SRM investors are interested in long-term investments. Because of this, the token rate will not be subject to a strong correction when the price of the SRM token rises. Bottom line: Serum Token (SRM) is an ideal medium-term investment at the moment and will show good growth in the next few weeks.",1621966376,"Why Serum (SRM) is an amazing investment right nowAfter the last market crash, which happened amid news about regulation from China and an artificial dump from Elon Musk, there was a large influx of cryptocurrency to Coinbase Pro wallets.

However, the commission on the BSC network, the network bandwidth, the latest news on Binance audits and the thoughts of investors about the pseudo-centralization of BSC by the Binance team, are the reasons tokenization cannon be fully realized on BSC. Even after Uniswap V3 update, which happened in an attempt to maintain technical competition with projects such as SushiSwap, PancakeSwap and Curve, the platform wasn’t able to reach the level of the protocols that it’s competing with. Why is Serum token the most promising on the market for medium-term investments? The release of the Solana blockchain platform to the masses in such a short period of time contributes to the emergence of new projects and tokens working on the Solana blockchain. The most convenient way of all on the market for direct swap of tokens on the Solana ecosystem is the Serum platform. Unlike other DEXs on the market, there are no centralized vulnerabilities in the Serum platform, which instills fear in users of other DEX platforms. In addition to supporting tokens on Solana, Serum fully supports ERC20 tokens on ETH. Serum staking is one of the best stakes to deal with centralization. To be eligible for Serum staking (SRM), a staking node needs to have 10 million SRM and one MegaSerum (MSRM) staked (1MSRM=1 million SRM). The Serum price on ATH at $12.89 did not make a large number of hodlers sell the asset, which indicates that SRM investors are interested in long-term investments. Because of this, the token rate will not be subject to a strong correction when the price of the SRM token rises. Bottom line: Serum Token (SRM) is an ideal medium-term investment at the moment and will show good growth in the next few weeks.",3447,50,3397

CryptoCurrency,"Bears, Bulls, Bitcoins: Why supply is king and why we haven’t seen anything yet","Hey everyone, I was doing some math the other day and feeling very bullish.  The following is me multiplying and dividing various numbers and thinking I know the entire future. I’m basing my predictions off of one of the oldest and most important aspects of economics: supply and demand.


So currently, the block reward is 6.25 btc/block after halving last year. There’s about 144 blocks a day so that totals up to 900 a day and 328,500 a year 

In 2024, it will go down to 3.125, so 450 a day and a total of 164,000k a year. 


I’m predicting a big peak in 2025 at around $165k but that will depend on if the current bull run is actually over or if we’re just balancing out. 


Ok so this is when things get really juicy. Between the growing adoption of Bitcoin and the crypto markets and the increasing rarity, I think from 2028 on the price will start to be insane. 


When the 2028 halvening happens, we will drop down to 1.5625 per block, 225 a day and only 82,125 a year. 

This halvening is super significant in my opinion. First, this is the last chance to gain a full Bitcoin per block for the rest of history. After 2032, it’s all decimals. The second important thing about this year is it’s the first time we’ll be getting less than 100k bitcoins added. 

Something else to consider is the loss of coins. Whether people loss their keys, die, lose their ledgers, or whatever, bitcoins will continue to be lost, making the circulating supply even smaller. 


As I mentioned before, once we hit 2032, the block reward will be down to 0.78125. At this point, do you think people would even keep mining if that wasn’t worth a decent amount? No, it’s unlikely to me. I think the value of Bitcoin has to scale with the block reward. At the time of writing this, the current block reward of 6.25 @ $38,500 would be about $237,000. 

This is not the most scientific way to do things but if we divide that number by the 2032 block reward of 0.78125/btc, we would get a value of $303,360 per coin. 

Now, all the numbers aside, there’s an awful lot that can happen by then. Between regulation, institutional investments, technological changes, solar flares, nuclear war, economic collapses, global pandemics, etc. Bitcoin is still so young, it’s really impossible to know. But my takeaway would be just keep stacking it up bit by bit. The price may seem high sometimes but I have a feeling it’s nothing compared with what it will be. 


i like buying magic internet coins with money, this is not financial advice. 


TLDR: Bitcoin is limited, going to get much much much rarer over the next 10-15 years.  The value could, should and quite possibly will be a few hundred thousand within a good handful of years.

CryptoCurrency,I consider myself a crypto veteran. Been in for a few years now and there is one piece of advice that I haven’t seen on here yet. Any help from any veterans more seasoned than me would be appreciated.,"So when I first got into crypto I knew about the volatility so I only invested what I could afford to lose. That amount quickly became more than I was willing to lose but I didn’t sell. As fast as it went up it came crashing down and I lost half of my investment. I kept hearing about diamond hands and hodl which I didn’t fully believe at the time but I went with it. Well fast forward a couple more bull runs and crashes and I started noticing that my hands were actually becoming like diamonds. I thought wow they were serious and all along I thought it was a joke. This isn’t my problem though as I have heard a lot of people on here talking about diamond hands so I knew I wasn’t alone. Where things started to get weird is after this last crash I saw more money than ever leave my portfolio balance and instead of panicking I bought more all the way down. Now lately I’ve been noticing that I’ve been getting holes in my underwear every night when I get home. Upon further inspection I noticed that my balls where turning to diamonds now. Has anyone else had his problem? I’m sure that I can’t be the only one. You never hear about diamond balls on here. If you have experienced this and have any advice it would be appreciated. Maybe what kind of underwear holds up best, how to deal with the extra weight, will they grow back if I cut them off and cash in for more crypto. I don’t know what to do.

CryptoCurrency,Exit Strategies,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking (day dreaming) about what to actually do once I hit my personal moon and just exit strategies in general. Everyone has their own opinions that range from hodling forever, to cashing out at the first 50% increase.  **Obviously, there is no right answer and DCA seems to be the general safest bet. Commenting ""HODL!!!!1111"" isn't really going to help anyone here.** While there's nothing wrong with hodling, I'm trying to figure out what to do when I hit my targets.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to hear more specific strategies from other members to give me ideas, that hopefully inspire others to consider their personal targets.  Considering I hold BTC, ETH and numerous alt coins, I'm sure that my portfolio is similar to others. I generally see strategies that aren't very specific, I'm curious to know the details if you're willing to share. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's pretend that the markets skyrocket to new ATHs next month, at what point do you make a move?

Do you cash out to fiat and put it in savings account?  
Do you reinvest your profits into other cryptos?  
Do you reinvest in stablecoins and stake for high interest?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone! Hopefully this can be insightful for the newbies and everyone that's interested.",1621963951,"Exit StrategiesHi everyone,

""Bitcoin will never hit 50k""

&amp;#x200B;

""My son Spencer K Schiff went all in on Bitcoin on the last drop below $50k. 100% of his portfolio is now in Bitcoin. He sold the last of his silver stocks to raise the cash. If my own son is this brainwashed imagine how vulnerable most kids are. He's HODLing to infinity or bust."" - Mar 10, 2021

""Bitcoin is very unlikely to ever hit $100K.""

CryptoCurrency,Paypal sucks and let me tell you why.,"So I was trying to make a car payment using my Paypal card as I have been doing for the past 6 months. And on the 23rd I tried to make a payment and it declined my card and told me to try again later. Of course I did so and fast forward to today I tried again. Declined. So I called my lender and they basically told me it was my bank. So I called Paypal and tried to solve the issue. I was transferred between 3 people for them to tell me it was a security issue and that there was nothing they could do. They told me to try again in 24 hours, and if that didn't work I wouldn't be able to use their card to make a payment. Banks shouldn't be telling me where I should or shouldn't use my money.

CryptoCurrency,Made a token but don't know how to make it sellable,"Hey guys. I finally made a token and a website for what my friends and I think may be a decent token that serves a purpose and isn't really dumpable other than if someone buys a bunch now... I made a token and read that to add value I need to send ethereum to the contract address. First, I was told to send the tokens I want sellable to the contract address, so I did. 90% of them. But noone including my friends and family can buy any. I don't think there is any value. So I tried sending Ethereum to the contract address using metamask but kept saying ran out of gas. Kept increasing until finally it said failed, without the out of gas message. 

Do I need to have an ico? I read that in the US those are trickier with the IRS, etc. So I figured I could skip that step and just send some Ethereum. 

What am I doing wrong? It'll just be a small coin between friends most likely, unless it takes off, which would be nice but not expected. 

If I need to create an ICO token, can someone point me in the right direction? I made a token website but am I going to need an ico website and ico token? I used a web app to make it easy but whatever you know, please help me so I can allow my friends and family to purchase the token using ethereum.

CryptoCurrency,Elon Musk is a Troy Horse probably the biggest threat to bitcoin,"To explain my theory I will sum up the events that have happened during the last months related to Elon Musk, how he is being used as a troy horse to destroy bitcoin and I will speculate with what is coming in the near future.

# First event: Tesla buying bitcoin and accepting payments in bitcoin

This is the big entrance of Elon in the crypto community. He is a popular entrepreneur and investor that has the sympathy of the community, so here he comes, bitcoin pumps and all heil Elon our new saviour. This is how the troy horse is introduced in the community.

# Second event: Doge pump

Elon pumps this shitcoin to make some fun. He shows how powerful he can be when dictating cryptocurrency prices, so now every time he tweets it has an impact on investors and speculators. Now he can do whatever he wants with the prices.

# Third event: Tesla stops accepting bitcoin

Now that the Troy horse has consolidated its power and invaded the community, he starts to destroy it. He questions bitcoin decentralization and power usage and in this way he creates a problem that did not exist before in the community. This is an old manipulation tactic that has worked for centuries.

Of course price tanks, not because of him, but that is what uneducated people believe. So his power continues to be projected.

# Fourth event: Elon speaking with miners

So now he speaks with miners to solve the problem he has created, and ""it looks promising"". Of course there is a minipump, which his friends use to liquidity some longs.

# What is coming next

So now the troy horse along with other billionaires will start the ""importance of bitcoin being green"" propaganda. Once people believes them, the next step will be to create a cartel of green bitcoin miners. As bitcoin is completely traceable, they will control the supply. You just have to know which miner addresses are green and which ones are not.

Later on exchanges that trade non green bitcoin may have to stop doing so, creating a different price on green bitcoins vs regular bitcoins and therefore killing bitcoin fungibility.

Another possibility is, if you hold non green bitcoin you will not only pay capital gain tax, but also sustainable tax. Of course this new tax can be completely arbitrary. This further exacerbates the pressure on those non green bitcoins which will be sold at discount. Then when the Troy horse and his friends control the supply of non green bitcoins, they will make it green by including them in transactions which are mined at green miners, so that they can profit from this difference in prices.

I am quite sure events will unfold moreless this way, and this will be how bitcoin gets killed. Of course bitcoin community can stop this by adding privacy layers, but they won't do so as they have become complacent with respect to other communities.

I think the Troy horse and their friends will control bitcoin before the next halving cycle.

CryptoCurrency,$VIAGRA: A Community-Driven NFT Marketplace That Donates to Men Health Charity -,"Community-driven decentralized projects have made the most of this bull season and even meme currencies that are similarly backed by a strong community have propelled to new highs be it Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. Another use case that has gained a lot of popularity in 2021 is Non-Fungible Tokens aka NFT. NFTs have become a goto token for celebrities from all walks of life to auction their rarest art piece and memorabilia saved onto a blockchain for secure identity. In 2021 alone one of the highest-grossing artwork was sold via NFT for $69 million by a digital artist Beeple. Viagra combines the best of both worlds as it brings a community-driven NFT marketplace which would also initiate a charity program that would offer regular help to the community-voted charity funds from time to time.

The Viagra Project will provide much-needed funding to women’s health charities across the globe. The stigma surrounding men’s mental health is ever-present today, even with all the fantastic work that is being done to talk about it more. At Viagra, the community plan to make donations every two weeks to bring with them, rising weekly as the market cap grows. Every time you buy or sell viagra, you are helping to contribute to our community-voted chosen charity, so the team thanks you for being involved and helping to make a difference. Please check out our social media channels for upcoming merchandise,

I think we should try to spread more awareness about crypto in order to truly push crypto mass-adoption. I mean sure, the profits can be great, but we shouldn't just look at it as a way to make great profits alone.

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin price must now hold this key level to regain $40K,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices pulled back on May 25, wiping a small portion of the gains it had made during the previous session amid another day of volatile trading.

The BTC/USD exchange rate fell up to 6.11% after opening the Asia-Pacific session at $38,856. The pair met a strong resistance force near its 200-day simple moving average (20-day SMA) that prompted a majority of traders to secure their intraday profits.

As a result, the bids for the BTC/USD pair started dropping while heading into the early London session, eventually finding support at a level that was instrumental in limiting the market's bearish trend during the last week's price crash.

Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader, called the blacked horizontal line in the chart above — roughly $37,000 — a ""key retest"" level, noting its significance in determining Bitcoin's short-term market bias.

The analyst put a blue arrow above the support level that pointed north, stating that he anticipated BTC/USD to bounce back in the coming sessions. 

""Bitcoin turns $37,000 into support in the short-term,"" tweeted Rekt Capital. ""But might need to retest that area once again given how strong yesterday's Daily Close was Still on track for following the blue path.""

The statement appeared as Bitcoin continued its whipsaw trend, logging sudden intraday reversals of high percentage margins. The choppy price movements reflected an absence of clear directional bias among traders, especially as analysts weighed equally convincing bearish and bullish catalysts against one another.",1621960053,"Bitcoin price must now hold this key level to regain $40KBitcoin (BTC) prices pulled back on May 25, wiping a small portion of the gains it had made during the previous session amid another day of volatile trading.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep this in mind when you think of selling your whole bag and leaving the Cryptoverse for good.

FUD will always come and go, we have seen this with every run and while it hits us hard its only temporary and even if Bitcoin is characterised as ''DEAD'' for the 215235th time I can say with certainty that it his here to stay. When in doubt, look back to the Mt.Gox incident (read up on this to udnerstand more), if BTC and crypto didnt die back then, its almost impossible for any news to stop it now.

Keep a clear mind, take profits, prepare for the worst and enjoy the ride. Nothing will always stay Bullish and nothing will always be Bearish. Patience is key.

PS. Any news you want to add let me know i can edit it in, but please provide a link, I am also very open to discuss the above news articles and hear opinions on them.!!!

CryptoCurrency,"I Put All My Savings into Crypto a Few Days Before the Crash, Down Big, but Learned My Lesson","I have known about Cryptocurrency since like 2014, but I never paid attention to it since I didn’t really understand it and I didn’t have any money to put into it. I witnessed 2017 from the sidelines as well. Moving forward to February 2020, I began using Robinhood once again to play around with stocks until I stumbled into Dogecoin at .03. Put $50 dollars into it and notice my gains right away. I wasn’t thinking that this investment would make rich or anything, I just thought that if I ended up putting some money into it, I might get some good returns. So, I Kept putting a few dollars here and there until I acquired about 25k Dogecoins. At one point, before the SNL thing, my Portfolio was up over a thousand percent.


As time went on, I became more interested in crypto, but I still didn’t understand it and only saw it as an opportunity to get some gains. So, I started to investigate Altcoins and began to invest some of my savings. I started with $400 and in a matter of days, I had put all my savings in it roughly USD$22,500 into numerous cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, ADA, ALGO, XRP, MATIC, XML,)


My plan with Crypto was never to get rich. All I wanted was for Doge to remain in the .50s and .60s. Additionally, I wanted my $22.5k to turn into like 28k-30k and then I would cash everything out for a down payment on a second rental property. The market took a big dip, and the rest is history. So, in summary...


My Mistakes
Greed got the best of me. I was already up big in Doge, if I had cash out, I would have had some good progress that would have accounted for 2 years of Student Loans payments, replacing my old car, boost to savings. But I didn’t.

Invested in something that I did not understand. 

Tried to time the Crypto Market. I thought it was the perfect time to get in.

Tried to “diversify” my portfolio by buying different crypto, mostly Altcoins who might take a long time before they even go back to the price, I bought them. 

Invested more that I could afford to lose. When I put money into Doge, I could afford to lose maybe $1,000. Sure as hell I cannot afford to lose $22.5k though. 

Lessons Learned

All my life I thought I was somewhat financially savvy. Guess not. It was a big realization that I have so much to learn about myself and about money in general.

I learned that you truly learn your lesson when things happen to you. Learning vicariously is not as effective as people may think. I obviously knew that you should only invest only what you can afford to lose, or to go slowly, and that a good portfolio should be diverse in terms of stocks, crypto, cash etc. I was aware of all these investing strategies. But I still went on ahead and did my thing. 

I did more research on Crypto in general and not only became more interested in it, but I actually believe in Blockchain Technology now. I am more informed now about the projects that I am currently invested in and will continue to be more informed

My Plan

I am an anxious person by nature. I check my portfolio. I refresh this sub. I look at YouTube. Most of the time I think to myself, if I could go back, I would have done things in a different way. But that’s just not how things work obviously. My plan is just to minimize the effect that this is having on me and not to continue to lose sleep over it. For some people, I guess being down it is not that big of a deal since they might be used to it, but for me it is a big deal. I haven’t sold yet. I’m still up 500% on Doge and down 30% on the other Portfolio. Right now, FUD is getting the best of me thinking that everything will completely crash and leave me with nothing. I would hate to sell at a loss, but I would also hate to have to wait years for my portfolio to recover, but I am going to try to calm down a bit and focus on some other things rather than looking at charts all day. I’m thankful to this community and let’s just see what happens.",1621959801,"I Put All My Savings into Crypto a Few Days Before the Crash, Down Big, but Learned My LessonI have known about Cryptocurrency since like 2014, but I never paid attention to it since I didn’t really understand it and I didn’t have any money to put into it.

CryptoCurrency,The FUDbath that just happened caused $4.53 billion equivalent in realised losses on Bitcoin. There are charts!,"This post is basically paraphrasing https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-on-chain-week-21-2021/ which is an excellent resource and goes into more detail about this. 

So. One of the best things about blockchain in bitcoin is the public ledger. We can track bitcoins as they are sold and bought.

That means you can track bitcoins as they are transacted. You can tell that the bitcoin sold today was bought in 2019 for 12000 and sold for 60000 in 2021.

So with the latest crash we can track when the bitcoin was bought and for how much. And what we learn is:

Short term holders were taken by surprise and panic sold. Very few addresses holding bitcoin in profit sold. Most bitcoin that were sold had been held less than 6 months and were sold for a loss.

This chart shows the total realised losses. The next is net losses.

Here we see profit taking happened much earlier. Glassnode suggests this means that holders were taking profits for capital rotation into ETH. During the capitulation, these long term holders almost stopped entirely.

And the next shows the age of the coins being spent.   


https://preview.redd.it/iua5hqj4ha171.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0a51bffe3303f704e70604e81426e2234f39fe4

Glassnodes insights analysis suggests that there have been three kinds of sellers: 

""There are three primary groups of entities that are likely to generate sell-side supply:

1. Coin holders at a Loss who are largely buyers from the last 3-4months.

2. Coin holders in Profit who may believe the macro top is in.

3. Miners who need to sell to cover costs or are forced due to new Chinese regulations.""

Nb. The macro top is the top of the bull market, as opposed to a local top, a temporarily ath before a pullback and another rally. Ie if you think 60000 was the macro top and btc wont hit that again for a long while it was a good idea to get your capital out.

Final thoughts

This is why you dont fuck around with leverage. This is why you dont invest more than you can lose. This is why you should have enough liqudity to live at all times. You dont need to panic. 

To those that sold at 60000 and are now buying back in. \_Well played.\_ 

To the rest of my hodl friends worrying - is this the end of bitcoins?! No. This was actually what people on this sub have been warning against - a newbie bubble.

I've been wondering about USDT for a while. For a while I just believed that other people did their DD and it was fine to trust USDT. But I don't believe that anymore. Everything I can find online right now points towards USDT not actually having the assets to back up their worth, meaning, were enough people to try and withdraw USDT to dollars right now, USDT will collapse. 

How high that percentage is? We don't know. They might have 100% of their minted usdts backed, it might only be 20% or less. 

Why does this matter? As you can see from the second link I posted, a really large portion of crypto is bought with USDT. A currency that might actually not be backed by actual assets. This means that if/when USDT collapses the whole market will be fucked alongside it. 

This is just my takeaway from the things I saw, I could very well be wrong. I hope I am, but I do feel like we need to talk about this.",1621958525,"Let's talk about USDT - is it a fraud?https://newrepublic.com/article/160905/tether-cryptocurrency-scam-enrich-bitcoin-investors

CryptoCurrency,Who else did Binance screw over during the crash last wednesday?,"I'm curious if there are other people like me that got screwed over by Binance throwing (JSON) errors preventing you to close your position and other network issues that caused major loss in your positions during the big crash last wednesday.

As for me, my short position got liquidated at \~$2050 (because of the network issues, i wasn't able to close it myself before liquidation would hit). At that point they froze all access to my positions, but instead of immediately placing market orders at that price point around \~30 minutes passed before the market orders were finally placed.  During this time i was greeted with a ""Failed to load TradingView due to network issues"" screen, and when things finally got back up the price moved \~$500 higher. Well, on a \~75 ETH short, this resulted in an extra 37.5K loss on top of the liquidation that i was forced into due to the errors. The system in place that should at least prevent bankruptcy by liquidating in time actually effectively caused it.

This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.""

Do what YOU like to do with your money, investments, trades, coins. Dont always listen to people on the internet, dont go all in because someone said so, take a break, think, DYOR, and know how YOU feel about it, it might be foolish, you might lose all of it, but in the end you will know that it was you who LIKED to do that thing.",1108,31,1077

As always:  
\- Don't invest everything. Keep a part of your income as savings. I like the rule 0f 30-30-40 (30% for investments, 30% for daily costs of life and 40% as savings)

  
\- This is not a get-rich-scheme. Be patient. The ones that got rich with crypto where extremely patient, clever, or a bit of both.

  
\- DYOR: Do your own research before investing a single penny in any project.  There're full guides out there about what you should study about a crypto (i'd say: dev team, teoric use case, real world use case, history and adoption)

  
\- DCA: Dollar-cost-average your way in and out any investment. Divide the ammount you planned to invest in a project in daily, weekly or monthly. This way you're almost inmune to changes in price.

  
\- DTA: Don't trust anyone. Nobody gives nothing for free, not even information. especially if we're talking about invstments. You don't know if that one who's trying to persuade you to buy, hodl or sell has interest in it and why. Trust yourself only and take your own decisions.

  
\- Nobody has ever gone broke by taking profits, so don't be ashamed to sell if you decide to. Don't let the ""Hodl"" gang change your mind.

  
\- Don't try to time perfectly the market. As my teacher always said ""Just sell. Let someone else win the last penny""

CryptoCurrency,[Newbie Advice] DCA or Wait and Hold?,"Hi! I’m very new to the crypto space (legit just got in May 10 so...... lol) and was hoping to get some opinions/advice from people more knowledgeable and experienced.

I’ve already put in quite a bit of money.. tbh, more than I’m willing to lose (it hit like a drug and I couldn’t stop lol). Thankfully it’s not so much that it’s detrimental to my life or survival, it’s just more than I’m willing to gamble with. I put this money in before the big crashes so I’m debating what I should do.... should I continue to DCA now that the prices are so much lower even though I’ve already put in quite a hefty sum? Or should I just wait it out because it’s too precarious and dangerous to put in more?

From what I’ve read, it seems to me like this crash is a little different. Although there have been large crashes in the past, this one seems as though this one is a bit unprecedented because big changes in the space are on the horizon (eg. government crackdowns and regulations)? But the general consensus also seems like we’ve entered a bear market that we won’t break out of for quite a while so maybe it’s not necessary for me to make a decision right this instant? But I’d still like to know what people are generally thinking. Like I said, I’m very new to this so I’m assuming my understanding of something this complicated is very superficial and not very thorough.

Not sure what info would be relevant but FWIW, I’ve only purchased BTC and ETH both properly and on Wealthsimple (respective avg cost $58,730CAD and $4020CAD for the former, $56,650CAD and $4830CAD for the latter so yeah... down bad), I’m currently saving to move out of my parents’ place, and I work full-time. Like I mentioned, I have some money that i COULD put into it but I’ve already put in way more than I had originally planned to prior to starting out. Putting more money in would obviously mean that I could get into green sooner but with a lot more risk of course. What would people do in my position?

Putting more money in would obviously mean that I could get into green sooner but with a lot more risk of course. What would people do in my position? Any insight, advice, resources, etc. would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",2098,37,2061

CryptoCurrency,Best Blockchain Data Provider?,"Whats up guys,

I'm currently conducting some research for my PhD into the cryptocurrency market (specifically algorithmic/non-collateralised stablecoins). I'm wondering if there's an all in one data provider that would provide metrics such as transaction rate over time, hash rate and block size for individual coins. As a plus it'd also be great if it also provided emerging trends in the crypto market and market share of stablecoins . I've had some luck with 'The Block' and 'BitInfoCharts' - I'm wondering if there's some all in one goldmine I've yet to find.

Does anyone have any tips on the best/fastest way to transfer fiat to an exchange? 

For me, there's a dip and like a good little crypto trader, I think this is the perfect time to buy. Only issue is that I don't have any fiat on an exchange. So I transfer some and 24 hours later once it arrives the dip has recovered 80-90%. But hey, I have the money there now, might as well buy something. Then a couple of days/week later, another dip, rinse and repeat.

CryptoCurrency,Tax question for a newbie,"Hi, 
So like many others, I dove head first into crypto thanks to Doge. I now own a fair amount of ETH which I see as a long-term asset, whereas I always figured doge would be a quick buck.

My question is the following:

I ultimately sold Doge for $1000 profit about a month after buying it. My short term capital gain on that would be 22% (based on my income bracket), which would be $220 owed to the IRS -- correct?

I am, like many others, at a loss right now on ETH. How can I use this to my benefit to erase my $220 tax liability? I understand that crypto is not subject to the same wash rule as stocks (at least not yet). So if I sell enough to realize a $220 loss, and then immediately buy it back, I wouldn't owe those taxes, and I also get the benefit of lowering my ETH average cost....right?

Just trying to understand for the future. I've learned so much about crypto in such a short period of time.",1621955455,"Tax question for a newbieHi,

CryptoCurrency,Strategy/Bot proposal,"I just got into the market less than a month ago. Great introduction, right? Currently my portfolio is down about 20%, so all in all I’m not doing so bad, but if I had not panic-sold my MATIC that I bought at $0.77, I'd be ahead. I have found that monitoring the market is giving me a lot of mental/emotional stress, so I’m trying to come up with ideas for being invested well long-term without having to monitor the market. So I thought of this and I wanted to get some feedback.

Assume a regular monthly allotment of cash to spend in the market that funds a bot that does the following:

1.	Check crypto X on a regular basis (hourly?)
2.	 If X is above its 200 day MA, purchase Y amount where Y is some % of available funds (Y/100?). Otherwise, do nothing.
3.	If X is below its 200 day MA by some substantial % (10%?), sell substantial % (potentially 100%)

Is this a reasonable approach at all? if not, would tweaking those percentages make it more reasonable? What would be the most reasonable/profitable percentages?

I understand the concept of being invested in appreciable assets long-term, and I understand that the above can run counter to that philosophy, so perhaps this should only apply to non-ADA/BTC investments. Currently my portfolio is approximately 70% ADA (roughly 75% of which I am staking), 10% BTC, with the rest some DOT, some MATIC and cash. Ideally I would like to have a higher percentage of BTC, but other than that I'm open to suggestions.

Of course that paid off but I found myself feeling empty, like I was missing the idea of cryptocurrency’s. 

 One of my random coins was XLM, I watched it slowly move up and down as it ascended in price.  I was also a frequent visitor to their sub, until I got banned for sticking up for a fellow hodler.  I remember reading about XLM’s goal was not for their coin to climb in price but to actually be useful, something Satoshi wanted for Bitcoin and ultimately ended up a clown show. 

 Stellar foundation has projects like SureRemit (RMT) built on it, making it much easier for the people of Nigeria and Kenya to receive goods and services, by offering a fast and extremely inexpensive way to transfer non cash remittances in the form of gift cards. I am confused as to how a project doing such great things for people in need has very little attention brought to it. 

 Nigeria is cryptos largest market.....think about it.....Largest market, why is that you ask?!!! One of the reasons is because they don’t have access to fiat.

CryptoCurrency,Why is centralization such a bad thing?,"From my understanding these are some of the arguments against it:

* If mining becomes centralized, they can control the blockchain.
   * Well, they still have to adhere to the protocol. So any invalid transactions or signatures will be rejected. Worst case, a hard fork will be needed.
   * They have no incentive to do anything malicious since it will just hurt them.
* Few will control all the coin
   * Yes, they will get all the rewards, but I guess it's fair if they have the proof of work. If others want to also get the rewards, they can increase their hash power and decentralize to whatever extent is required (sort of a balance).
   * Everyone can just buy coins from the central authority. If they don't sell or try to burn them, it will just increase the value of the remaining coins and hurt them in the process.

Overall, it seems like centralization isn't catastrophic since it doesn't actually hurt people using the currency. It just inconveniences other miners and if it gets too bad, can be fixed with a hard fork.

Just like the crash last bull run, China FUD sparked major concern. Here we are again with more. What happened last time there was China FUD? They beefed up mining capacity like crazy.

CryptoCurrency,It’s my cake day so I will give you all some words of wisdom,"I started buying crypto in 2017. I made an initial investment of $7K which turned into $120K at the height of the bull run. My initial goal was to 2x my investment. When I hit $14K greed took over and I said “alright, I’m cashing out at $50K”. But I waited. Then I hit $100K. I thought “damn good thing I didn’t cash out or I would have missed out on so much”. 

Delusion took over and my new goal was $1M.  Why not? It was *only* 10x more. Then cryptos started crashing. I held on due to greed. It’ll bounce I thought after every crash. Because I was all in on alts I soon found my $120K was $4K. Not only did I lose all that paper gains but I even lost some of my initial investment (technically didn’t lose because I didn’t sell). At this point, I decided to just hold onto to it. Well the bull run came back and my $4K was up to $60K or so. I ended up selling to pay off some student loans and CC debt. Yep, I missed out on a lot more gains if I held on this time around, and who knows what will happen. I’m sure it’ll go up for few more months… but I didn’t want to be left with nothing for a second time. At least now i can save money and DCA in for the next bull run in a few years. 

This story is not that unique, it happened to so many people. Don’t let greed stop you from taking profits. It’s not minimizing profits, it’s minimizing risk. 

There’s a lot of people who think “all or nothing” and that’s not necessarily wrong but keep your expectations straight. You’re not going to be a millionaire with a $1K investment  in one bull run, save for the extreme outliers that buy absolute shitcoins that moon. BUT you can be a millionaire within 2 maybe 3 cycles of the bull run by DCAing profits up and reinvesting profits during the bear market. 

There are people who decide they don’t want to deal with the stress and work and rather just keep their coins and not trade. That’s fine too and it will work out. But this applies only to legit projects. You can’t keep a meme coin for decades (maybe I’m wrong but it’s not an outrageous assumption). 

Anyway, I’m out of crypto because I accomplished what I needed this run - paying off debt. I’m saving straight cash now and waiting for the next bear market to DCA in. No I don’t think the bull run is over just yet - so don’t take this as fud. I’m just a random redditor who is happy for paying off soul crushing loans. 

Best of luck to you all, and see y’all again in a few years. We will all be on yachts soon.",1621951545,"It’s my cake day so I will give you all some words of wisdomI started buying crypto in 2017.

CryptoCurrency,The Big Kids just Joined our Little Game.,"Alright guys and girls I'm gonna throw this out there. There's a major shakedown happening in crypto right now. Big money is getting wise to it's inevitability. There are a couple side effects of this your doctor should have warned you about. On one hand, no one is denying that the market is being manipulated so that the big boys can get in before the mainstream public. I'm sure you've all see the video about the wychoff distribution. 

All this news about Elon and friends trying to clean up bitcoin is another obvious power grab. And they're just the first ones. I don't expect this to be the last. Thousands have died in history in the pursuit of gold. And if bitcoin is really digital gold like you all think it is, expect our unregulated industry to get messy fast. 

There is a positive to this as well however. When big money gets into something they defend it. Dragons will do anything to defend their horde. This means we will finally have representation in government through lobbies. Granted, these lobbies will work for banks or institutions and defend their interests before the small investor. But if your plan is to hold long term, then this can only benefit us. 

We're in a transition phase right now. The big boys are holding small investors' feet to the fire trying to get every last Satoshi out of you guys. If you've ever watched how banks invest, they are usually in something for the long term. Individuals are notoriously easy to shake. Thus the term dumb money. 

Obviously this isn't investment advice, but what were witnessing here is a grand buy in by those who want what you have. You can either give it to them at a discount, or wait. In a few years i imagine we'll all be on the same side of this.

Now let me start by saying I also believe and invest in Bitcoin but where Bitcoin is acting more like gold and as a storage of value, Ethereum offers a very different value proposition that I feel is often misunderstood and undervalued.

Let me also say that because I make a case here for Ethereum it does not mean its competitors like ADA, BNB, DOT or even NEO are bad or do not have a lot of potentials. As matter of fact, I invested in those coins as an edge on ETH and believe they are all healthy competition.

When thinking about ETH a lot of people stop at it’s the second biggest market cap and it has fees issues so it can’t grow much more.

But bare with me here while I share with you some of my due diligence on Ethereum because I believe there is more to ETH than meets the eye.

Let’s start by understanding the difference between a coin and a token. Coins are native to their own blockchain. Whereas tokens have been built on top of another blockchain, like… Ethereum.

So ETH is a coin and a lot of tokens are actually based on the Ethereum blockchain. And by a lot I mean a lot! At the time of this post, almost 400,000 tokens have been created on the Ethereum blockchain. Don’t believe me? Have a look here:[ https://etherscan.io/tokens](https://etherscan.io/tokens)

Although a very high percentage of those tokens are currently worthless (do some careful Due Diligence before investing in low cap tokens) there are hundreds of them that are major cryptocurrencies and most people don’t realize they are Ethereum based.

For example, did you know that the below tokens are based on the Ethereum blockchain?

* Binance Coin (initially, now move to its own chain)
* UniSwap
* VeChain
* Chainlink
* Etc…

That also the top 3 (and many many more) DeFi (Decentralized Finance) tokens are also based on ETH? 

* Maker 
* AAVE
* Compound 
* Etc…

With billions of dollars (66 to be precise) locked in DeFi. See[ https://defipulse.com](https://defipulse.com/)

But that’s not it! Some major stable coins are also based on Ethereum;

* USDT (partially)
* USDC 
* DAI
* Etc…

And last but certainly not least let’s not forget all those NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that are also based on ETH see[ https://etherscan.io/tokens-nft](https://etherscan.io/tokens-nft) :

* Sorare
* FND
* ENS
* Etc…

Side Note: consider getting your ENS (Ethereum Name Service) the equivalent of a Domain for the Ethereum ecosystem that will be very useful with DeFi services in the future. [https://ens.domains](https://ens.domains)

I would really recommend scrolling through[ https://etherscan.io/tokens](https://etherscan.io/tokens) and see how deep the Ethereum Iceberg goes! It gives a good idea of how big the ETH-based ecosystem actually is.

But why does it matter that all those tokens are ETH-based? Because to use the Ethereum blockchain they need to pay fees in ETH!

Looking at the daily transaction volume trend on Ethereum is also a good indicator of the growth of the ecosystem. The current daily average is $1.4 million and has surpassed the peak of the ICO craze of 2018. More info here:[ https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum\_transactions\_per\_day](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_transactions_per_day)

Now let’s address the elephant in the room: The ETH fee problem. Yes, it’s a real problem. But what is causing the Ethereum fees to be so high? Simply put: because ETH victim of its own success. The network is congested and it’s hurting Ethereum as a lot of great projects are moving to competitors like BNB for example. But it’s not like the Ethereum team is not aware of it or sitting on their hands. They are hard at work trying to fix the issue with a move from PoW (Proof of Work) to PoS (Proof of Stake). When ETH 2.0 is fully rolled out (next 12 months hopefully) fees issues should be resolved (good article here:  [ https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-save-on-ethereum-gas-fees](https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-save-on-ethereum-gas-fees/) ) and it is even likely ETH become deflationary! Meaning the volume of ETH will decrease.

In terms of timing, you are still early! In the nineties when the internet started to grow people thought it would become a third media pillar next to TV and Radio. Turns out it overtook the other two pillars that are now internet-based.

Today a lot of people see the blockchain and DeFi as a new asset class that will co-exist with traditional markets and exchanges. I think DeFi has the potential to overtake the traditional system and Ethereum will play a big role in that.

Look and what already exists today: StableCoins like UDST (partially based on ETH) or USDC (based on ETH) act like cash, coins or tokens are like company shares, shitcoins act like penny stocks or pink sheets (and a huge number of them are based on ETH), locked stacking is already acting like bonds but with much better yields, DEX (decentralized exchanges) like UniSwap (based on ETH) are showing very promising results and bring much-needed transparency in the exchange space (do some DD on the GME case to see what I mean) and also lending/borrowing platforms like AAVE (also based on ETH) are growing fast.

Investing in Ethereum now is like being in the nineties and having the opportunity to invest in a monetized version of the internet protocol (TCP/IP) before it becomes what it is today.

I would therefore argue that at around $2,500 ETH is a bargain considering its value proposition. I would recommend that investors who truly see and understand the potential of Ethereum consider hodling their position for at least 5 to 10 years and even stake part of it today to earns interest. Almost $10 billion worth of ETH is already staked to make 2.0 a reality. More info on staking here:[ https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/). But you can also stake your ETH on big exchanges. On Binance it’s as simple as converting your ETH to BETH.

Side note: if you own some ETH you don’t have to do anything to “convert” them to 2.0 it will be automatic.

In conclusion, I for one, think that ETH could easily surpass $10,000 (this would mean a market cap of around $1T) in that time frame if not go way higher. Especially when the fees issue is fixed. What do you all think?

CryptoCurrency,''Invest in a coin and then check back after 2 years'' is the most misleading advice that I keep seeing in crypto,"Necessary disclosure, I'm a newbie at crypto investment.  

From what I've seen since I started trading crypto, there is this one idea that gets almost unanimous approval in this sub and any other crypto discussions I have witnessed. It is the idea that if you buy something, move it to a native/cold wallet, delete the exchange and check back in 2 years you will be crypto rich. Even with my limited experience I can tell you this is horrible advice.  

This implies that it isn't your point of purchase that creates the possibility of high gains but how long you can wait. With this advice you don't care at which point you enter because it will obviously 1000x at some point, but you also don't care about which point you enter because it implies that crypto is on a never ending upwards trend. Most shitcoins you buy today and check back in 2 years won't even be there, or will have made insane profits like SHIB but you will have missed it since you thought it was a good idea to not look at anything crypto and delete your exchange app. 

This idea also invalidates the importance of having an investment strategy. The only times when I haven't lost my profits in this last bull season was when I knew my exit point before I bought in. With buying and waiting for a certain amount of time, you have no clue when you should exit.  

You're essentially buying high, possibly due to FOMO and without a planned exit point, then you're holding onto this handicapped position for 2-3 years only to come back to a bear market or a downwards trend. Surely you could come back to the exact day this coin hits its ATH and cash out but it really wouldn't hurt to keep track of your own assets and be informed about your investment instead of letting luck and misbeliefs about crypto do all the work.  

What could improve this idea? I believe that the only way for this strategy to work is if you've already bought low, with an exit price defined and an alarm set while regularly looking at how crypto and your specific investments are doing in that 2-3 years wait time. Your exit point may come earlier too at which point you could set a stop loss for that position and see how much higher it will go if it's a bull run, and if you stay informed about your own assets, you will be able to act quickly if there is a problem with it like de-listing or bad news.  

There is nothing wrong with being an informed investor. I genuinely believe that these misbeliefs about crypto hurt newbies and that the main advice should be to do your own research and to get educated in the subject, not to buy and forget.",1621950162,"''Invest in a coin and then check back after 2 years'' is the most misleading advice that I keep seeing in cryptoNecessary disclosure, I'm a newbie at crypto investment.

CryptoCurrency,Chasing My Initial Investment (or how I diversified and lost),"TLDR:  Split up my ETH to diversify, will always have a portfolio worth less than my pre-split potential.  


Back in 2017 I got into Crypto like many people because I saw a way to invest a little and walk away with a lot.  I had a goal in mind, a magic number where I would pull out 2x my initial investment and still leave money in the game to play with.  The 2018 crash started slow and started just a few percentage points shy of my goal, so I held...and I held...and I held and I lost.  By March of 2018 I was at about 20% of my initial investment.  I consolidated everything I had left into a nice round number ETH.  At that point it was worth about $160 per coin.  Then I deleted my exchange apps and just let my ETH sit.  


When the recent Bull trend hit early in 2021 I saw ETH start to take off again.  I thought to myself, ""Self, this time we're doing it right"".  **I proceeded to screw up again.**  When ETH hit $2200 I sold half of it for a stable coin and fully intended to cash it out right then.  Things kept going up.  It was nuts!  So I traded in my stable coins for a variety of ""safe"" coins based on projects that I did research on and coins that returned interest for holding them on an exchange.  So far so good, I'm playing the game the way it's supposed to be played according to everyone that tells a crypto story with a moral or gives not-intended-for-financial-advice advice.  


If my entire portfolio still consisted of only ETH coins, I would be in a much better position.  As it is, my portfolio is at about 75% of what it could be.  So now, I'm chasing that ETH value.  I move more into coins that generate interest, I move into risky deals like Liquidity Mining or moonshots, and I keep getting farther and farther away from my original 2021 ETH baseline.  The gambler in me is having fun doing it, but I'm always a little bitter.


I wrote about post a while back about Diversified vs Too Diversified.  I don't think there's a difference in Crypto.  Most of the coins move together, but ETH and BTC move more than others and on their own.  I watched ETH go from $2600 to $1700 to $2600 in the course of a day, while my Vechain went from 15 pennies to 10 and back to 12.  The swing was unkind.  


All long stories need a moral right?  Here goes:  The smart money is in ETH and BTC.  That's about it.  Hold it if you have it, claim your profits if you need to.  Don't feel like you have to diversify; diversification is a myth if it's all in Crypto.  


Moral #2:  Have fun, if you've invested money that you can afford to lose then take risks on the off chance that there's a big reward.  I'm having a blast learning about new coins and new ways to generate income based on coins.  

And scene...",1621950079,"Chasing My Initial Investment (or how I diversified and lost)TLDR:  Split up my ETH to diversify, will always have a portfolio worth less than my pre-split potential.  


Back in 2017 I got into Crypto like many people because I saw a way to invest a little and walk away with a lot.  I had a goal in mind, a magic number where I would pull out 2x my initial investment and still leave money in the game to play with.  The 2018 crash started slow and started just a few percentage points shy of my goal, so I held...and I held...and I held and I lost.  By March of 2018 I was at about 20% of my initial investment.  I consolidated everything I had left into a nice round number ETH.  At that point it was worth about $160 per coin.  Then I deleted my exchange apps and just let my ETH sit.  


When the recent Bull trend hit early in 2021 I saw ETH start to take off again.  I thought to myself, ""Self, this time we're doing it right"".  **I proceeded to screw up again.**  When ETH hit $2200 I sold half of it for a stable coin and fully intended to cash it out right then.  Things kept going up.  It was nuts!  So I traded in my stable coins for a variety of ""safe"" coins based on projects that I did research on and coins that returned interest for holding them on an exchange.  So far so good, I'm playing the game the way it's supposed to be played according to everyone that tells a crypto story with a moral or gives not-intended-for-financial-advice advice.  


If my entire portfolio still consisted of only ETH coins, I would be in a much better position.  As it is, my portfolio is at about 75% of what it could be.  So now, I'm chasing that ETH value.  I move more into coins that generate interest, I move into risky deals like Liquidity Mining or moonshots, and I keep getting farther and farther away from my original 2021 ETH baseline.  The gambler in me is having fun doing it, but I'm always a little bitter.


I wrote about post a while back about Diversified vs Too Diversified.  I don't think there's a difference in Crypto.  Most of the coins move together, but ETH and BTC move more than others and on their own.  I watched ETH go from $2600 to $1700 to $2600 in the course of a day, while my Vechain went from 15 pennies to 10 and back to 12.  The swing was unkind.

CryptoCurrency,How to Use Being in the Red to Your Advantage in Crypto (US),"The market is down. If your accounts are in the red and you are in the US you should consider selling your crypto and immediately repurchasing it. This allows you to offset a capital gains tax liability and in the equity world is called a wash sale. 

**Crypto Sales Taxes**

We all know in the US that according to [IRS Publication 544](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p544--2020.pdf), ""When you sell virtual currency, you must *recognize any capital gain or loss on the sale*, subject to any limitations on the deductibility of capital losses"". We can use that to your advantage if you are in the red.

**Crypto=Asset**

The [IRS treats crypto as a ""capital asset""](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/virtual-currencies) and this is important when we talk about selling and immediately repurchasing. If the IRS treated crypto as a security this would not be possible.

**Wash Sale**

A wash sale is *selling a stock or security at a loss*, realizing the loss for tax purchases, and repurchasing the same or ""substantially similar security"" within 30 days. The IRS does not allow you to claim the capital loss on a wash sale of a stock or security per [Section 1091](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1091). The wash sales rules came into effect in the 1920s and were expanded in 1993. 

\-Most definitions of wash sales that you see today will include the word security and/or stock. Before the IRS formalized the wash sales rules in the 1920s, the definition was broader. I am using this pre-1920s definition that would include crypto. 

**Crypto=Asset=Wash Sale OK**

The IRS is very specific is Section 1091 that the wash sales rules apply to ""*stock or security*"". They are also very clear that crypto is a ""*capital asset*"". This would mean that there is no rule on the books not allowing a wash sale on crypto. This means it appears you can tax-loss harvest crypto and immediately repurchase it without waiting 31 days.

**Capital Loss Uses and Restrictions**

You can use your capital losses to offset capital gains in the same tax year. 

1-If your capital loss is from crypto you owned less than a year it is a short term capital loss and first offsets short term capital gains (gains from holdings less than a year). 

2- If you have more short term capital losses than short term capital gains, then it is applied to long term capital gains (realized gains from items held over a year). 

3- If you still have capital losses you can declare a $3000 capital loss. This $3000 capital loss can be applied to offset “ordinary income”, that fiat you mine. Now, if you still have capital losses you can roll them over to next year and rinse and repeat this process. 

If it is a long term capital loss, long terms gains are first offset, then short term, then ordinary, then rollover and repeat. 

**Risks of Realizing Capital Loss**

There is always a chance that the IRS can change the tax code and treat crypto more like a security/stock in these situations. There is often a fee involved in your crypto trade and there is the chance of a price change in the time it takes you to sell and rebuy. You will now owe taxes based on the new ""purchase price"" when you next sell the crypto. If you have held your crypto for longer than a year, I would only do this if you plan on holding for longer than a year in the future.

I am not a tax professional. This is not tax advice. Make sure you contact a licensed tax professional on all tax related matters.

I haven't been able to find a way to automatically buy and also automatically sell what has been bought later on so far.

There must be a way to do that, right?

There's no automation on also selling that Bitcoin again if the price goes up or severely drops.

Decided to do a test buy  100$ of XRP @. 88 before dropping anything too serious.

I rushed to the market, to see what the price was figuring it had gone back over a $1. Nope, literally the same price as when I hit buy.

I'm kinda at a loss here. I definitely want to buy more because I believe in the project, but clearly that jump in price negates my attempt at buying in low.

The count of accumulation addresses climbed to a record for the seventh consecutive day on Monday, taking the total to 545,115, according to Glassnode data.
The number has increased by 16,445 since May 8 – a sign of persistent bargain hunting by long-term holders during bitcoin's slide from $58,000 to $30,000.
The balance held in accumulation addresses has jumped by 30,000 during the same time frame, hitting a two-month high of 2.79 million BTC.
Glassnode defines accumulation addresses as ones that have at least two incoming non-dust (tiny amounts of bitcoin) transfers and have never spent funds. Essentially, these are long-term holder addresses.
Over-the-counter (OTC) desks have also seen substantial outflows over the past two weeks, signifying dip-demand from institutional investors.
On Monday, OTC desks tracked by Glassnode registered an outflow of 11,883, the most since early September.
However, inflows to OTC desks wallet also spiked to a 5.5-month high of 12,392 on Monday. Inflows indicate an intention to sell but do not imply immediate liquidation.

There are stable coins like USDT, BUSD that are pegged to the US Dollar (fiat). However, on apps like Binance we are able to get around 5-6% APY which is much more than what a traditional bank offers.

CryptoCurrency,Blockchain Ambassadors,"Hello!

Long time lurker, first time poster over here. I would not in anyway consider myself a blockchain expert but I have extensive experience working with and investing in blockchain startups since 2016. Safe to say that I am a fan boy. 

I was inspired by a lot of the community members and wanted to share some thoughts with you. My thoughts are personal opinions and could very well be 'wrong'. For this reason I warmly welcome an engaging discussion with all the beautiful minds who might see things differently. At the end of the day, we all learn / grow together.

These are my thoughts:

* Crypto today as a sub-set of blockchain is proof of the immense potential of blockchain and is necessary for the blockchain industry to grow. 
* Crypto is front-facing and 'media-friendly'. The average Joe might know Bitcoin but much less likely to know blockchain, so much so that many refer to crypto as Bitcoin. Even though the average Joe might not know it, he becomes a part of the blockchain industry the moment they invest in any crypto. 
* Investing in crypto should not be viewed as a quick get-rich scheme. It should rather be viewed that by investing in the 'right' cryptocurrency (tokens of companies with real utility / disruptive potential) we are helping shape the digital architecture of trust and governance for the future. Investing in blockchain today, is the equivalent of investing in the internet companies of the 90s (of course some boomed and some busted). 
* We as a community believe in this technology and its disruptive potential. We want it to grow and we want to see the projects that we believe in achieve their goals.
* As a technology we are still in our infancy and the total crypto market cap shows that. We have a long way to go but anyone who understands the basic essence of blockchain technology, its potential and applications across countless verticals / use-cases can rest assure that getting there is only a matter of time. 
* Today, the media and institutional investors are dictating our narrative. Media blasts non-FUD when things are good and FUD when things are bad. Media brings in FOMO-type retail investors to help institutional investors sell at the top and buy at the bottom. 
* I know a lot of us get pissed at FOMO retail investors and bandwagoners who don't research, don't understand the first thing about blockchain and expect clouds raining lambos. They come in, lose their money by panic selling at the first dip and then shit-talk crypto as a scam. Can you really blame them? I would answer yes and no. Yes, because they violated two golden rules: no one should invest into anything they do not know  enough about and they should not invest more than they can afford to lose. No, because well, they are only human beings who live complicated lives like any of us. They face financial troubles like any of us and they are constantly bombarded with content about how some guy made an investment of 100 dollars and retired a multi-millionaire from crypto. They are only human beings who are succumbing to the most basic of human desires - a hope of a more prosperous future for themselves and their loved ones. 
* This is where we can step in as ambassadors. We need to educate them as much as possible. Better than educating them about crypto, would be to educate them about blockchain - it's potential, why it's so disruptive to many industries / verticals / use-cases and why investing in these companies by 'proxy of crypto' is a good investment. Imagine each one of us, 2.9 million community members took the time to explain to the people in our close circles all about blockchain and its future.  I believe that we can help those around us to see investment into crypto as a long game not a short one. That would ultimately help them understand the value of what they're holding so that the next time there is a massive crash / downtrend  people are buying much more than they are selling. It's easier to hold when you understand why you are holding and what you are holding despite all the noise, turbulence and FUD.
* I think as ambassadors who believe in this technology and want to see it's market cap grow larger and larger, it's our job to answer questions, raise awareness and excite new retail investors.

Thanks for reading. Interested to know what you think.",1621946792,"Blockchain AmbassadorsHello!

Long time lurker, first time poster over here. I would not in anyway consider myself a blockchain expert but I have extensive experience working with and investing in blockchain startups since 2016. Safe to say that I am a fan boy. 

I was inspired by a lot of the community members and wanted to share some thoughts with you. My thoughts are personal opinions and could very well be 'wrong'. For this reason I warmly welcome an engaging discussion with all the beautiful minds who might see things differently. At the end of the day, we all learn / grow together.

These are my thoughts:

* Crypto today as a sub-set of blockchain is proof of the immense potential of blockchain and is necessary for the blockchain industry to grow. 
* Crypto is front-facing and 'media-friendly'. The average Joe might know Bitcoin but much less likely to know blockchain, so much so that many refer to crypto as Bitcoin. Even though the average Joe might not know it, he becomes a part of the blockchain industry the moment they invest in any crypto. 
* Investing in crypto should not be viewed as a quick get-rich scheme. It should rather be viewed that by investing in the 'right' cryptocurrency (tokens of companies with real utility / disruptive potential) we are helping shape the digital architecture of trust and governance for the future. Investing in blockchain today, is the equivalent of investing in the internet companies of the 90s (of course some boomed and some busted). 
* We as a community believe in this technology and its disruptive potential. We want it to grow and we want to see the projects that we believe in achieve their goals.
* As a technology we are still in our infancy and the total crypto market cap shows that. We have a long way to go but anyone who understands the basic essence of blockchain technology, its potential and applications across countless verticals / use-cases can rest assure that getting there is only a matter of time. 
* Today, the media and institutional investors are dictating our narrative. Media blasts non-FUD when things are good and FUD when things are bad. Media brings in FOMO-type retail investors to help institutional investors sell at the top and buy at the bottom. 
* I know a lot of us get pissed at FOMO retail investors and bandwagoners who don't research, don't understand the first thing about blockchain and expect clouds raining lambos. They come in, lose their money by panic selling at the first dip and then shit-talk crypto as a scam. Can you really blame them? I would answer yes and no. Yes, because they violated two golden rules: no one should invest into anything they do not know  enough about and they should not invest more than they can afford to lose. No, because well, they are only human beings who live complicated lives like any of us. They face financial troubles like any of us and they are constantly bombarded with content about how some guy made an investment of 100 dollars and retired a multi-millionaire from crypto. They are only human beings who are succumbing to the most basic of human desires - a hope of a more prosperous future for themselves and their loved ones. 
* This is where we can step in as ambassadors. We need to educate them as much as possible. Better than educating them about crypto, would be to educate them about blockchain - it's potential, why it's so disruptive to many industries / verticals / use-cases and why investing in these companies by 'proxy of crypto' is a good investment. Imagine each one of us, 2.9 million community members took the time to explain to the people in our close circles all about blockchain and its future.  I believe that we can help those around us to see investment into crypto as a long game not a short one. That would ultimately help them understand the value of what they're holding so that the next time there is a massive crash / downtrend  people are buying much more than they are selling. It's easier to hold when you understand why you are holding and what you are holding despite all the noise, turbulence and FUD.
* I think as ambassadors who believe in this technology and want to see it's market cap grow larger and larger, it's our job to answer questions, raise awareness and excite new retail investors. No need to go full rambo rage mode on that poor soul that lost all his money on a shitcoin. A little guidance, support and empathy will go along way to help us grow bigger and stronger as an industry / technology. Like it or not, we need mass adoption to get to where we want to get to.

CryptoCurrency,There is an extremely dangerous and harmful lie being constantly perpetuated in this sub. STOP IT.,"""You aren't at a loss if you don't sell"". 

You see that comment being upvoted literally everywhere. But it is complete bogus. 

It's like saying ""I don't age if I don't celebrate my birthday"". You are just lying to yourself.

More specifically, it is called the ""sunk cost fallacy"" (please read up more about this), and it is an **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS MINDSET** to be in.

Imagine someone mortgaging their house and putting it all in bitconnect, and everyone is just like ""if you don't sell, you aren't at a loss.""

This line could **literally ruin entire families**. People who perpetuate it should be ashamed of themselves. STOP IT. 

The fact is, even the most experienced billionaire VCs with dozens of smart, well-educated analysts from ivy league schools, as well as connections with all of the other rich folks in every sector, leading them to opportunities no ordinary people can find... 

Even they fail on 7 out of 10 of their investments and only make it all back on that 1 in 10 hit. 

If people always held and never cut their losses, they would **almost certainly lose money**. 

Do you know how many of those 10,000 coins on CMC are completely dead now with no liquidity? The majority of them.

Look, I've been in crypto since 2014 and I haven't cashed out even $0.01. I didn't sell my VET even when I had over a 90% loss in 2018. 

The HODL mentality isn't about holding your bags until you're bankrupt. It isn't about lying to yourself about your losses.

HODL is about not basing your decisions 100% on minute-by-minute emotions based on how the market is doing. HODL is about not FOMOing in when things are mooning, and not FUDing when things are crashing.

It's about **knowing why** you are in a coin, and that you believe in the long (or mid or short term, whatever goals you had in mind based in your thorough research) term, your why hasn't changed.

It's perfectly fine to abandon a bad decision you made earlier when you were less well-informed, or when things were different. In fact, **you should abandon bad decisions ASAP**. 

Don't HODL bad decisions. 

Do your research. Make your decisions based on rational understanding, not emotions. Make changes to those decisions as you get better, more well-informed, or as new information comes up. Don't make decisions based on emotion rather than logic. This includes FOMO, FUD, or being overly attached to the sunk cost fallacy.",1621946537,"There is an extremely dangerous and harmful lie being constantly perpetuated in this sub.

This is my personal opinion and based on facts that I've found. After the recent crash we should expirience a dead cat bounce - but we won't. This potentially means that the bullrun is not over but will continue (shortterm). Why? Because there are big players in here:

**The Game of Life and Money**

**Millionaires**: They are good at the game and practise everyday. They are generally smarter than most of us and know how to play their cards. They also do wrong decisions and can pretty quickly mess up.

**Billionaires**: They only make moves if they win. If it turns against their odds, they will do *everything* to stop it and manipulate so they at least come out with a small profit. **THEY NEVER LOSE**.

So Elon Musk shit talked crypto (or BTC) and it fell... and look who is not in profit anymore? So he keeps tweeting together with Michael Saylor. I think they are really trying to keep this bullrun up as long as they can. Maybe at first for fun and hype but surely they won't exit their liquidity with a loss.

CryptoCurrency,Hey guys. This might be the early bear market. It also might be a dip mid-bullrun. Could we maybe tone down the certainties and try to differentiate a tiny (!) bit again?,"I won't pretend this sub ever was a haven of calm and differentiated discussion, it never was - at least never since I joined a few months ago. But the past few days feel super weird. Since the crash six days ago, the market has been very volatile - but I feel like the sentiment on here is even crazier than the market.

Yesterday until this morning (European time), looking at the daily thread, it seemed like most people were 100% convinced the crash was over, now that most coins have dipped a few % again it's almost the polar opposite, we're doomed and nothing can safe us. Since the crash, there were alternating red and green days, and I swear, every day the sentiment swings and people are convinced it will keep going the same direction forever.

Dozens of posts pop up with clear data and proof why this is *definitely* the end of the bull run and you should sell everything now ^(not financial advice) and others with 100% secure evidence that we are *exactly in July 2017* right now and everything will start shooting up again every minute now and you should buy the dip ^(not financial advice).

It's annoying. Can we get a bit more rational again? We don't know what will happen. We crashed pretty hard. It might keep going down, or we might go towards the ATH of most coins again. Don't pretend you know, and don't tell others what they should do right now - it might very well be awful advice. A red day doesn't mean we'll keep crashing, and a green day doesn't mean the crash is definitely over. Let's wait for a few weeks, I think we might be able to understand the situation much better then.

CryptoCurrency,Merchants who accept payment in crypto need to incentivise payment in crypto,"... or else it's merely an attempt to generate hollow publicity for the business.

Existing crypto longs (whether hodlers or traders) aren't gonna trade their precious crypto for pizzas anymore, and crypto shorts are probably gonna find paying in crypto to not be worth the trouble. People who havent joined the fray aren't gonna take the plunge merely because a merchant is ""now accepting payment in crypto!!11!"".

Merchants who truly see the value of crypto should be driving mainstream adoption by instead giving a discount (eg 10%) if someone pays in crypto instead of fiat (or at least crypto instead of credit). That way, there'd at least be SOME incentive for someone buying a pizza to say ""ok i dont wanna touch my hodlbags for this, but idm buying some on spot right now, at least so i can save 10% on this purchase"".

Why would merchants take the added risk that comes with offering a discount on crypto payments? Because 10% is nothing, and in fact can be priced into the sale price (the same way cc fees are priced in)!

CryptoCurrency,PSA: Crypto is Not a Viable Asset Class for Some US-Based Real Estate Lenders,"I am going through the home buying process – I know, *in this economy?* lmao. I am currently working with a nationwide lender in the US (will not mention by name) and was informed that none of my cryptocurrency assets would be acceptable towards the cash to close amount of the home according to their guidelines.
 
I was fed the typical *’The market is too volatile and too young to have us accept those funds as an asset’*. Even if all I did was withdrawal my initial investments, that can easily be tracked through bank account statements via the memo lines that read “COINBASE” or “BINANCE”, it still would not be accepted.

An asset is an asset once it’s in my bank account so I fail to see the issue. Large deposits would flag in their system and I would have to answer as to where they came from.
 
I asked “What if I call it a gift from a family member?” and was told that the IRS would probably get involved as I would have to provide documentation of the ‘gift’ and it would be seen in my account statements as coming from a Cryptocurrency exchange. So lying is a no go – I figured this going into it I just thought I would ask about possible loopholes in the system.
 
I will be able to cover the cash to close without accessing these funds. My plan was to use my crypto as an emergency fallback in case of unexpected costs that may come up during life. To know that I will no longer be allowed to use those funds is a little annoying, particularly not even being able to use my initial investments.

CryptoCurrency,🚀 The Preparation Work to Launch a Token,"Last month when I was surfing on the internet, I saw many new coins were out there for purchasing.

Many of them are good in marketing and promotion.

Regardless what is inside their project, I saw many of coins, were actually held by thousands of addresses.

Today I want to walk you through, how to launch your own COIN!

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Idea is NOT Everything, but Everything Starts with an IDEA.**

Idea is important. A good idea should lead to a good sales figure. You can think as big as you want and write a roadmap of it. By posting to your website, you're going to reach thousands and millions of visitors.

**2) Choose Your Blockchain Mainnet.**

There are 2 common blockchain out there for you to choose. Back then when there is only Ethereum available, people created their smart contract to launch their coin. Checkout the ERC20 standard right here to know more about it. [ERC 20 Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.mdv)

But now, you can choose to deploy onto a more affordable chain, Binance Smart Chain.

**3) Write Your BEP20 Smart Contract**

Actually you can copy from other people. Go to github and search for that. Remember change the name and the code for your token. Parameters are adjustable such as total supply, tax fee, etc.

**4) Launch Your Token on Swap**

Uniswap and PancakeSwap are available at your own choice. Go checkout their DAPP for launch the token on swap site.

At last, all you need to do is to promote...

CryptoCurrency,"Really need help, received money from bank for scam and chased the scammer for my own money back after in crytpo","Hi there,

First things first, this is on my mind.  I am a straight shooter and do things always by the book, maybe it's my anxiety.  I have been investing into crypto since 2017.  I held a lot of coins, and in the end sent some of these coins to a scammer (a friend of a friend recommended me him).

I also sent this scammer money via bank transfer.  I got this money back from my bank after I logged a scam claim.  However, overall, I am still down because I sent him crypto, right?

So the bank refunded me, and here I am chasing my other money which is a pain to even receive, it's been months and he has been playing me, but now and then I get some money (so far GBP 1000 in GBP back).

I realise when the time comes I cash my crypto in for money, 

1) Will the bank ask for proof of funds (I have records of me showing my own deposits, but I also noted I received crypto?

2) Will they ask who I received crypto from, do I need him (scammer) to show proof of funds, because thats impossible and I honestly dont feel safe knowing where he gets his money, but I dont think its right he gets away with it

3) Morally, i feel like it doesn't look right that after the bank refunded me, I received money from the scammer, but I am still down overall, and in my head this is fair... how do I go about this, what is the right way?

Has anyone cashed in their crypto before, what is the right way/best way to do it? I will do a tax self assessment and show all my deposits and withdrawals/received funds.  Am I doing anything illegal (I hope not, I have anxiety/ocd so maybe this explains a lot)?",1621944242,"Really need help, received money from bank for scam and chased the scammer for my own money back after in crytpoHi there,

CryptoCurrency,The posts in this sub right now make it clear there is a piece of advice that is missing.,"There are so many posts at the moment about being down anywhere from 10-90%. This seems totally insane to me given we've basically been in market frenzy for the previous month or so. Many coins up 100s of %. But it occurred to me that perhaps the guiding principles advocated in this sub is not explicit enough. I thought I'd done a pretty good job [summarising here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n7u6kg/does_anyone_else_just_quietly_follow_the_standard/) but now realise perhaps I'm guilty of this too.

**The meme is ""buy the dip""**. It's almost said jokingly at times but I think we generally understand the premise that something that has demonstrated the potential to operate at a higher price at least feels more likely to be able to return to at least that price (whether or not this is true). So by buying dips you hope to increase your exposure to price rises.

There is a corollary to this of course: **""don't buy the climb""**.

We often talk about FOMO but perhaps that's not clear enough. Those of us with long-term approaches to this will have been Dollar Cost Averaging in as normal. When there is a dip, I move my DCA forward to account for this and consider this to be normal practice so that I can afford to buy the dip. However, 1, having just bought the dip my next DCA is now delayed (which helps to avoid buying on a climb) ,2, if it's rocketing up basically unencumbered this is NOT a good time to buy: you might consider *delaying* the DCA. 

Now before someone jumps in to suggest that you could miss big gains: Big jumps happen fast. What is the other core piece of advice given? DON'T day trade. When the price is rocketing up what will you need to do in order to make a profit? Sell quickly. Probably within a day or two, if not the same day... Do you know what buying and selling on the same day sounds a lot like?

Buy the DIPs.

Don't buy the climbs. 

On buys since Jan I've yet to go into below breaking even and in fact have remained in a more than decent profit the entire time. I bought when it dipped but NOT when it was moving high fast.

Keep waiting until they go above my investment?","I made an account on Binance a week ago. After researching, I liked multiple coins and ended up buying 12 coins. I want to sell at least 6-7 of them. But now, I can't figure out the best strategy to remove them because I'm at a loss.

I want to take the advice of everyone that says don't sell at a loss. I agree with them. Removing them now wouldn't be a smart thing to do. I don't mind waiting, but what's the best strategy to remove them when the time comes?

1) Gas Fees. No normal person would pay the fees that exist today. Everyone says fees will come down when sharding happens, but they don't say to what levels, which makes me suspect they will still be too high for normal peoples tolerance

2) Everyone says they are ""in it for the tech"" but you know what I never see? Anyone arguing eth is the best tech-wise. The only defence I see from people who hate the newcomers is that eth has first mover advantage and is too big to fail. Or ""they don't even have smart contracts yet"" or ""VHS was worse than betamax yet they still dominated""

And for a space that is obsessed with telling speculators to be ""in it for the tech"" and to follow the projects with the best tech.

CryptoCurrency,If “Buy the Dip” is rule one..shouldn’t “Sell the peak” be rule two?,"Right off the bat, let me say that I fully believe that in a couple of years, the market will be far higher than it is today and far higher than it was at any peak we’ve seen so far.  If your strategy is “DCA and Hodl” I think you will make great profit.  This post is not questioning your strategy.

If, though, you are the type of person that combines DCA with an occasional bigger purchase, consistently looking to “Buy the Dip” in a bull market...then surely there must be a corresponding strategy for the bear market?

I’d suggest this strategy is “Sell the Peaks”.  You continue with your DCA into the falling market.  But whenever there is a sudden and sharp upward spike, sell a little and use it to increase your regular weekly purchases.

I’m probably missing something but doing this seems a logical way to increase holdings over time.

CryptoCurrency,What happens when/if btc (or any other crypto) becomes the global currency,"I am reading a lot lately on crypto and macro economics (after taking the ""bitcoin for everybody"" course at saylor acadamy, which I highly recommend), and these are some points that I am confused about at the moment.

**Would appreciate your views and also recommendations on books/articles/podcast episodes that you are aware of that address some of the concerns I raised below.**

\----------------

The year is 205x and the BTC price has risen and risen, and it has reached, say a valuation of millions of USD (if according to some predictions, btc market cap could reach 100T, which makes one BTC will be worth around 5Million USD).  

Then say the unthinkable happens and the whole world bows down and accepts it as the one and only global crypto currency. BTC is money and money is BTC.

*What happens then?* 

*what will motivate miners to continue mining (since their income will be mainly transaction fees instead of btc rewards with each halving), and if the transaction fees become too high, which will deter people from making the transactions (or will it just end up like the credit card processing fee that visa/MA charges, and either the seller or the buyer of the service/product has simply to cover for it).*

*Then, there will be no ""market cap"" to talk about, at there is no fiat to measure it with.  So does that mean the market cap of BTC will be fixed just as the total number of BTCs that are available at that time? What will happen, say, if someone, through quantum computing or some other magic, fucks up the whole btc blockchain or we suffer a 51% attack.... will the whole global economy collapse?... do we need some ""backup"" currency/asset to hedge against such a highly unlikely scenario but with a catastrophic outcome?* 

*Will there still be a role for private banks? for federal/central banks? credit cards? Or will everything ends up being defi (based on ETH as it is now, or based on a defi based also on btc) where all debt/loan is P2P? How things like mortgages and credit card loans will work (as they are based on long term trust that the person will be earning enough money in the future to pay back, while there is no such trust in the crypto space)?*   

*If money becomes deflationary, as that will happen with btc, will overall inflation disappear and year by year, the price of goods and service (in btc) will decrease?  Then how will we define ""growth"" of companies, countries, etc...  what will be the new ""GDP""?*

*What will be the impact on taxes, social security, public spending, pension, etc..?*",1621938543,"What happens when/if btc (or any other crypto) becomes the global currencyI am reading a lot lately on crypto and macro economics (after taking the ""bitcoin for everybody"" course at saylor acadamy, which I highly recommend), and these are some points that I am confused about at the moment.

But my point is this: if those 50 billions were used to buy crypto at a cheap price, way before the ATH, then those scammers could have made way more than 50 billions, if you only think they could have made let's say a x5, this would be a 250 billions less in the market cap of crryptos in general, if they would withdraw everything before the scam will end in a bad way.

I'm not saying the cryptos will collapse totally, I don't think they will ever, and I hope not. Imo bitcoin will be forever with us, and also some other cryptos, I'm just wondering if it would not be better, to buy after this tether story will end.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto has helped me so much.,"Before i found crypto, i was genuinely depressed. im pretty young and i suffer from a lot of unfortunate health problems which i wont care to list as im not looking for sympathy, health problems which i am constantly trying to fix. i cut off all my friends due to this as i was embarrassed to open up, stopped going out and became a recluse who spent his days wasted on Netflix/ Youtube. i worked so hard to get into a top 7 UNI in the world for economics, but i flopped exams in my first year due to depression, i literally had to beg the admissions selector to let me progress to 2nd year.

upon discovering crypto it gave me a new sense of purpose. i love following these coins, investigating new startups to see what potential they have, going through the wave of emotions every time my portfolio goes up or down. the thrill of it all is something ive missed since i was a kid. this community is amazing, the majority of people are so supportive and helpful and i love spending my time on here filtering through threads and daily discussions. you guys helped me find good coins to invest in, taught me how to set up trading accounts, where to learn more about trading crypto as a whole.

having crypto as my purpose honestly changed my life, i started going to the Gym again, started eating healthy and waking up early, became more confident when i went out and more talkative with my family. i dont care if i lose all the money i put in, im so thankful for cryptocurrency and this community in general as it has honestly changed my life.

- Establishing a clear stop loss level can help you cut your losses; a skill that’s very rare in most traders.

Choosing a stop loss is not a random activity, and perhaps the most important thing to note here is that you shouldn’t be carried away by your emotions – a great point to set your stop loss is at the cost of your coin. 

If, for instance, you acquired a coin at $1,000, set that as the minimum point you’re willing to trade your coin. This will ensure that if the worst comes to pass, you can walk away with what you invested in the first place.

The same applies to profit levels if you target to get out of the market after hitting a certain minimum profit; stick to that. Don’t be greedy; it’s never a nice color on anyone!

I live in germany and the tax situation regarding staking is already pretty unclear. So in general we are more on the lucky side it seems since we dont have to pay taxes if and only if we hold our asset more than one year. If you earn passive income through rewards then first you have to pay taxes and second this one year holding period increases to 10 years. 
On top of that I wouldnt even know how to make taxes if I just automatically earn ALGOs without any type of recipe. I imagine if I stake on kraken or whatever that I can also view that in the history but if I kust leave it on exodus there would be no evidence at all right?

CryptoCurrency,Institutional Investors are here - WISEN THE FUCK UP PEOPLE,"We know that institutional investors are here, the big players, with billions of dollars to pump into this market.

I've seen a lot of posts which basically say ""But if we know they're coming in, why are cats falling out of the sky and everything is on fire?""

The answer is actually incredibly simple - market manipulation.

Think about it, this is still early days for the market. Not only that - it's unregulated.

If you had billions of dollars, and could get into an unregulated market where:

1) You believed it was going to be a successful market long term.

2) Your money would have a significant impact on not just volatility, but price action

3) You had the power to manipulate the unregulated market so you could get as many assets as possible.

Would you? Of course you would.

There are many recent events where this is clear - from Elon Musk pumping Dogecoin on Twitter for months, only to bring it crashing down on live TV, to FI's expressing their interest but not stating they've taken a position (they have - they're not going to tell you when they're about to do it, they're going to tell you months after they've done it). JP Morgan funnily enough announced they had a position as soon as this big dip came - funny that isn't it?

Which brings me to this absolute GEM of a video. This is not some ""moon wen?"" video. This is actual analysis which is pretty damn spot on.

So my message to all of you - wisen the fuck up. The big players are here, and more are going to be joining and manipulating the fuck out of weak hands. DO NOT LET THEM WIN. STAY STRONG.

And watch this video - this will prepare you for the upcoming shitshow more than any post in reddit will. What we've witnessed is a textbook Wyckoff Distribution move. Don't know what it is? Then get smart and watch. It's 20 minutes long, but it'll teach you A LOT, and calm nerves.

CryptoCurrency,20 reasons to buy and stake THETA in June 2021,"This is my first post on Reddit, so be nice.

And   also help me and other new investors to learn more about THETA. This  is  what I have learned so far, by reading and watching everything I  have  found about THETA.

&amp;#x200B;

20 REASONS TO BUY AND STAKE THETA IN JUNE 2021

(links to all the information is below the list)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mainnet 3.0 is coming on June 30th
2. Theta has 3 U.S. patents already for decentralized data streaming and delivery network
3. Big companies like Google, Samsung and Sony and have already invested/staked THETA
4. Really  impressive advisor board, co-founders of YouTube and Twitch and  many  more. Those guys know a thing or two about video streaming and how  to  reach hundreds of millions, or even billions of people
5. Some  of the biggest Silicon Valley's VC funds, and also VC companies  from  China and Japan, believe the project and have invested millions in   THETA
6. Theta  Labs partnered with the World Poker Tour and that is bringing  many new  viewers and new users to, for example, THETAs NFT marketplace  and  theta.tv
7. THETA  already has a working product: Google, Samsung and Sony-backed  Theta  Network wants to make it cheaper for companies to share video  content
8. THETAs  blockchain, format and patented ideas are suitable for not only  video  streaming, but also images, software, audio, smart contracts,  DApps,  NFTs, and creating your own TNT-20 tokens
9. THETA's main focus is bringing media and entertainment into blockchain, and that's where the big money is
10. Samsung  Next’s Patrick Chang said: ""I’m thrilled to be even more  involved with  Theta’s hyper-growth plans in 2021."" So if and when [THETA.tv](https://theta.tv/)   will be pre-installed in Samsung mobile devices Galaxy S10, S9, Note  10  and Note 9, that will extend Theta’s potential global reach to more   than 75 million smartphones and tablets
11. Sony  Europe follows in the steps of Global 500 firms like Google and   Samsung in joining the Theta network's validator program, and there you   have a potential Smart TV partnership
12. YouTube  co-founder Steve Chen (one of the THETAs media advisors) said  ""Theta’s  innovation is set to disrupt today’s online video industry much  in the  same way that the YouTube platform did to traditional video back  in  2005.""
13. THETA  price was already $15,90 when Mainnet 3.0 was supposed to launch,  but  the team postponed it 90 days because they wanted to ensure that  there  is a successful Mainnet 3.0 launch, and also with the key  partnership  opportunities the team needed to build some new foundational  elements  into Mainnet 3.0 core that are suitable for NFT
14. THETA  has a really big and talented team, for example, co-founders has   experience in developing multiple patented technologies including VR   live streaming as well as instant replays for video games. And they   blockchain team is massive
15. When they really start advertising, it's never a bad thing that Google is one of the biggest investors/stakers
16. Coinbase  CEO Brian Armstrong said that Coinbase is accelerating its  process for  listing new coins. THETA has been on Coinbase’s radar since  July 2020,  so the question is not if Coinbase is adding THETA, but when  Coinbase  is adding THETA
17. THETA  was already briefly a Top-10 cryptocurrency without any U.S.  exchanges  - what happens when U.S. citizens can start buying and staking  THETA  more easily from Coinbase and Kraken
18. When  THETA Mainnet 2.0 was coming, on May 27th, 2020, THETA price  increased  to $0.55, that was +205% in 15 days, +400% in 30 days and  +578% price  increase in 45 days before the launch
19. Now  THETA staking is not so profitable yet, but it's important and it   helps the network grow. When more big companies start to join in and   provide their services, then THETA staking is really profitable. When   more and more people realise how much passive income (yeah, those words   have a little bit bad reputation, but it's not only a myth and it  brings  people and money in) they can make by just holding and staking  THETA,  then it's going to be really expensive to buy 1,000 THETA (the  amount  that is required to stake)
20. “By  2024, one in three enterprises will use a multiexperience  development  platform to increase the speed at which IT and business  fusion teams  work to deliver successful digital products.” It’s not a secret that Theta Labs has spent significant time exploring and   driving blockchain technology discussions with large Global 1000   enterprises. These efforts have yielded results like bringing on-board   Google, Sony and Samsung as Theta Enterprise validators, media companies   like MGM and Lionsgate as content partners and Japan’s LINE  corporation  and Korea’s Kakao Klaytn as growth partners in Asia.

16. Coinbase  CEO Brian Armstrong said that Coinbase is accelerating its  process for  listing new coins. THETA has been on Coinbase’s radar since  July 2020,  so the question is not if Coinbase is adding THETA, but when  Coinbase  is adding THETA
17. THETA  was already briefly a Top-10 cryptocurrency without any U.S.  exchanges  - what happens when U.S. citizens can start buying and staking  THETA  more easily from Coinbase and Kraken
18. When  THETA Mainnet 2.0 was coming, on May 27th, 2020, THETA price  increased  to $0.55, that was +205% in 15 days, +400% in 30 days and  +578% price  increase in 45 days before the launch
19. Now  THETA staking is not so profitable yet, but it's important and it   helps the network grow. When more big companies start to join in and   provide their services, then THETA staking is really profitable. When   more and more people realise how much passive income (yeah, those words   have a little bit bad reputation, but it's not only a myth and it  brings  people and money in) they can make by just holding and staking  THETA,  then it's going to be really expensive to buy 1,000 THETA (the  amount  that is required to stake)
20. “By  2024, one in three enterprises will use a multiexperience  development  platform to increase the speed at which IT and business  fusion teams  work to deliver successful digital products.” It’s not a secret that Theta Labs has spent significant time exploring and   driving blockchain technology discussions with large Global 1000   enterprises. These efforts have yielded results like bringing on-board   Google, Sony and Samsung as Theta Enterprise validators, media companies   like MGM and Lionsgate as content partners and Japan’s LINE  corporation  and Korea’s Kakao Klaytn as growth partners in Asia.

For those that have been around the block a bit regarding crypto you will have seen a lot of rug pulls in your time. I really think this coin is here to stay.

I have been keeping an eye on the progress of this coin since its release 1/5/21. I have really found the clarity to be very refreshing. The team host multiple AMA's which are done with brutal honesty (you can find these in SoundCloud) which I always prefer.

The top owners are hodlers which has built a strong platform. It is built on the Binance/smart chain sibit has been effected by the sake drop as the remaining cryptocurrencies but it also looks to be recovering alongside Binance.

They do not tax on purchase and from the 10% sales tax 2% is redistributed to those holding, and a percentage going to charities which vary each month.

These charity payments are not one time payments. The charities hold a wallet and create partnerships with GGIVE.

The reason I wanted to write this post is because I am part of their telegraph group and I see how much the developers are doing in the background. I think this is a good invest and hold.

I do not solely hold GGIVE, I hold, ETH, BnB, BTC, xrp, dash, ADA, TRX, xlm so I understand the pain of the cryptocurrencies right now.

Before anyone posts FUD check out their website. Google GlobalGive charity token and you can go down their website and fall down that rabbit hole.",1621935247,"New charity coin GGIVE about be released on major exchange

### Ethereum's Logarithmic Regression Rainbow

https://preview.redd.it/4p9amvicg8171.png?width=3398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29578c5a1fe3d9fa5ff3721344e97ab6f7e618d2

**How To Read This Chart:**

* Using ETH’s historical price action, we can plot logarithmic regression trendlines that coincide with historical levels of support and resistance.
* These lines can be useful for navigating bull and bear market cycles, as well as for identifying critical levels of support and resistance.
* Do note that with each day that passes, ETH's logarithmic regression rainbow trends higher. This means the longer ETH can continue to trend higher to the next subsequent regression trendline, potentially the higher the market cycle top.

**What You Should Know:**

* At a current price of $2,618, ETH currently resides between Band 4 ($1,678) and Band 5 ($2,883).
* ETH's sell-off last week coincided with a backtest of band 4 ($1,678) support. If ETH can break through band 5 ($2,883) in the forthcoming days, we could see ETH press higher into 3Q.
* ETH would have to rally +10% to test resistance at $2,883 and would have to correct -36% to test support at $1,678.
* A move up to Band 8, which coincides with ETH’s previous market cycle top, would imply a $16,308 Ether and a +347.1% return from the current price.

### Bitcoin's +1 Yr. HODL Wave

*Processing img bt5681dgg8171...*

**How To Read This Chart:**

* BTC's +1 Yr. HODL Wave shows what percentage of coins in circulation haven't been moved in at least 1 year.
* When charted against BTC's price, one can identify trends that coincide with bull and bear market cycles. 
* Historically, a local top in the +1 Yr. HODL wave is congruent with the start of a new bull market. When the number of untouched coins begins to decline amid rapid price appreciation, one can be confident that a new bull market cycle is likely underway.
* When the downward slope of the HODL wave grows increasingly steeper, one can assume that selling pressure is beginning to increase and supply is likely to outpace demand. As such, a cycle top is presumably creeping closer.
* Prior to hitting a local high, a gradual increase in the +1 Yr. HODL wave signals that market participants are in ""accumulation mode.""

**What You Should Know:**

* BTC's current +1 Yr. HODL Wave reading sits at 54.4%, i.e. 54.4% of all coins in circulation haven't been moved in more than a year. This is down -9.0 percentage points from a local top of 63.4% set on September 9, 2020.
* Despite BTC's latest correction, the +1 Yr. HODL wave is little changed week-over-week. Last Monday's reading came in at 54.65%, only slightly higher than this week's reading of 54.4%. 
* On January 31, 2013, BTC's +1 Yr. HODL Wave hit a local high of 48.2% and the price of BTC was at $20.40. When BTC hit a cycle high of $1,158 on November 30, 2013, the +1 Yr. HODL Wave reading was at 38.8%. That is, over the course of 303 days, the number of coins that hadn't been moved in more than a year had fallen 9.4 percentage points while price appreciated +5,580%.
* On January 19, 2016, BTC's +1 Yr. HODL Wave hit a local high of 61.5% and the price of BTC was at $380. When BTC hit a cycle high of $19,660 on December 17, 2017, the HODL Wave reading was at 43.1%. That is, over the course of 698 days, BTC's HODL Wave fell -18.4 percentage points while price appreciated +5,073%.

### Bitcoin's 200W Moving Avg. Multiple

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9mk60a0ig8171.png?width=3568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=440ecfe0158007654dc4e7c76a1397896ebd772b

**How To Read This Chart:**

* **200W Moving Average:** A critical level of support used to determine an overall long-term market trend. The trendline measures the average price of BTC over the prior 200 weeks.
* **Moving Average Multiple:** The multiple with which BTC is trading at relative to its 200-week moving average. For example, a multiple of 4.0x means BTC is trading at 4x its 200-week moving average.

**What You Should Know:**

* In prior bull market cycles, BTC has traded as much as 10x - 15x its 200-week moving average prior to entering a bear market.
* BTC's 200-week moving average is 3.08x. That is, BTC is trading at 3.08x its 200-week moving average ($12,763), up from last week's multiple of 2.76x.
* Given today's 200-week moving average of $12,763, a 10x - 15x multiple would imply a BTC price of $127,630 - $191,445.
* BTC's 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 10.3X for the week of April 4, 2013. On April 9, 2013, BTC hit a cycle high of $259.
* BTC's 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 13.2X for the week of November 25, 2013, which coincided with a market cycle top of $1,158.
* BTC's 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 15.2X for the week of December 11, 2017. That same week, price hit a cycle high of $19,660.

### Bitcoin's Bull Market Weekly Support 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l866tjkkg8171.png?width=3402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aecbfeea46125efe3fd07463e435b625200cfbbf

**How To Read This Chart:**

* BTC's Bull Market Weekly Support tracks two critical levels of support that have acted as last lines of defense in prior bull market cycles: BTC's 20-week exponential moving average and 21-week simple moving average.
* In prior bull market cycles, BTC has mean reverted down to the 20W EMA and 21W SMA before bouncing and resuming its uptrend.
* When BTC breaks below both moving averages, the likelihood of BTC's bull market coming to an end is heightened.

**What You Should Know:**

* At a price of $39,250, BTC's 20-week exponential moving average is $45,209 and its 21-week simple moving average is $48,171.
* Currently, BTC is beneath the bull market support band for a second consecutive week. Given its historical relevance, a decisive close above both the 20W EMA and 21D SMA in the forthcoming weeks could serve as a massive tailwind for BTC if/when reclaimed. Until then, one could expect incremental bearish price action.
* A move down to BTC's 20-week exponential moving average would imply a -15.2% correction from current price.
* A drop down to BTC's 21-week simple moving average equates to a -22.7% drop from current levels.

### Bitcoin's Logarithmic Growth Curve

https://preview.redd.it/1tq9cf2pg8171.png?width=3404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a09b9d66712910c8dfdd0e0d21c7dc395498a84

**How To Read This Chart:**

* BTC's logarithmic growth curve consists of two sets of curved trendlines that have historically proven to be critical levels of support and resistance.
* While both lines point to price ranges whereby BTC is arguably ""overbought"" or ""oversold,"" they also represent a notable underlying property of BTC that can be found in social networks, technological innovations, pandemics, societies, and economics: exponential growth.

**What You Should Know:**

* BTC is a +114% to +181% move away from entering into ""overbought"" territory, which is currently between $84,114 and $110,129.
* BTC is a -42% to -56% move away from falling into ""oversold"" territory. This week's range is $17,368 - $22,740.
* At a current price of $39,250, BTC resides in the 42 percentile of the logarithmic growth curve's $17,368 - $110,129 range.

*Processing img l1c9w3bqg8171...*

**How To Read This Chart:**

* BTC's logarithmic retracement curve uses the growth curve's uptrending support line and historical price action to back into an implied market cycle top.
* Since 2011, BTC has long respected the growth curve's support line and has historically retraced down to said level upon hitting a market cycle top.
* When considering BTC's previous bull market cycles, one will find that it takes, on average, 385 days for BTC to retrace back down to the support band after hitting a top.
* Also, one will find that BTC has corrected, on average, -86% after the bull market ends. 
* By knowing where the price of the support curve is 385 days from today and making assumptions about how severe BTC will correct after hitting a cycle top, one can have a better sense as to where BTC would need to be trading to correct down to the support band over a period of 385 days.

**What You Should Know:**

* The price of BTC's logarithmic growth curve support 385 days from today is $35,680.
* Assuming BTC corrects -70% this market cycle, BTC would need to be trading at $118K for BTC to retrace down to support 385 days from today.
* An -86% correction implies a $258K cycle top and a -90% correction implies a $356K cycle top.
* According to this model, BTC is not currently in ""market cycle top"" territory.

### Bitcoin's Monthly Upper Bollinger Band &amp; RSI

https://preview.redd.it/p4iwdskrg8171.png?width=3564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d71dadd83e5b55ea0585a75a22c660e83f675785

**How To Read This Chart:**

* **Bollinger Bands:** A technical indicator that can be used to measure volatility and identify “overbought” or “oversold” conditions. When trading above the upper band, an asset can be considered ""overbought."" If trading below, the asset is considered ""oversold."" Oftentimes, the upper and lower Bollinger band represents a +/- 2 standard deviation move from a 20-period moving average. However, we'll be keeping an eye on a +4.5 standard deviation upper Bollinger band relative to BTC's 20-month moving average.
* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** One of most popular and widely used momentum oscillators. It measures over a 14-period duration and fluctuates between 0 and 100. A reading below 30 indicates ""oversold,"" a reading over 70 signals ""overbought."" Given its historical relevance, we'll be focusing on BTC's 14-month RSI.

**What You Should Know:**

* BTC's current intramonth high of $59,603 came $36,544 short of crossing its monthly upper Bollinger band of $96,147.
* BTC's 14-month RSI is currently 64.2 (""neutral""), the index's lowest reading since September 2020. The oscillator's move back into ""neutral"" territory coupled with BTC's current price indicates that BTC now has ample room to move meaningfully higher before lingering inside of ""overbought"" territory for too long.
* In April 2013, November 2013, and December 2017, BTC hit an intramonth high above its monthly upper Bollinger band as price set a market cycle top. Only in these 3 instances have we seen BTC break through its +4.5 standard deviation monthly upper Bollinger band. BTC's 14-month RSI also topped out well into ""overbought"" territory at a reading of 96.

### Bitcoin's MVRV Z-Score 

https://preview.redd.it/enga2lstg8171.png?width=3558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a14c273d3825da6d3815d60f9bb00784a51edfd

  
**How To Read This Chart:**

* **What Is A Z-Score?** A numerical measurement that can explain a value's relationship to a group's average. It is measured in terms of standard deviations. For example, a z-score of 0 means that a value is identical to the mean and a z-score of 1.0 means that a value is one standard deviation above the average.
* **BTC's MVRV Z-Score:** Considers BTC's market value and realized value to help determine when BTC may be over/undervalued. A z-score between 7 and 11 (pink box) suggests BTC is ""overbought."" When between 0.9 and -0.3 (green box), BTC is believed to be ""oversold.""
* **MVRV Z-Score Formula:** (Market Value – Realized Value) / (Std. Deviation of Market Value).
* **Market Value:** BTC's price multiplied by coins in circulation, i.e. market cap.
* **Realized Value:** The price of each BTC when it was last moved. 

**What You Should Know:**

* BTC's current MVRV z-score is 1.65, down -16.7% from yesterday's reading of 1.98, down -37.7% from last week's reading of 2.65, and its lowest level since October 20, 2020, when BTC was trading at $11,900.
* BTC's market value is down -6.5% at $656B and its realized value is down -0.2% at $370B.
* A +324.2% increase in BTC's z-score would put the indicator in ""overbought"" territory. A -45.5% correction would put the indictor in ""oversold"" territory.
* Prior z-score tops:
   * April 9, 2013: 11.05
   * November 23, 2013: 10.8
   * December 8, 2017: 9.77
   * Average score: 10.54
   * Note: These z-score readings topped out 1 day, 7 days, and 11 days, respectively, ahead of a market cycle top.
* On February 21, 2021, BTC's z-score hit a 3-year high of 7.62.

### Bitcoin's Pi Indicator

**How To Read This Chart:**

* BTC's Pi indicator leverages the 111-day moving average and the 350-day moving average multiplied by 2 to identify market cycle tops.
* Historically speaking, when the moving averages touch, a top in the current market cycle has been or will be realized.
* It should be noted that 350 / 111 equates to 3.153, which is as close to Pi (3.142) as we can get to when dividing 350 by a whole number.

**What You Should Know:**

* As of today, BTC's 111-day moving average is $52,455 and its 350-day moving average x 2 is $55,450.
* On April 11, 2021, the Pi indicator crossed for the fourth time in history. Approximately 3 days later, BTC hit an all-time high of $65,000.
* On April 6, 2013, both moving averages crossed when BTC was trading at $229. BTC hit a cycle top approximately 3 days later.
* On December 4, 2013, both moving averages crossed and BTC was trading at $1,130. Just 5 days later, BTC hit a cycle top.
* On December 16, 2017, both moving averages crossed. BTC hit a cycle top of $19,660 that same day.

### Bitcoin's SOPR Indicator

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s3e9g7kxg8171.png?width=3506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35a451a0fc544a470cc3800bfa0048cb2e80a103

  
**How To Read This Chart:**

* Bitcoin's Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) is an indicator that is calculated by dividing the realized value (the price of each BTC when it was last moved) divided by the value at creation of the output. Said differently, it is price sold / price paid.
* A SOPR &gt; 1 means that the owners of spent outputs are in profit at the time of the transaction. Because a reading &lt; 1 means market participants would have to sell at a loss, few are willing to do so in the midst of a bull market.
* History shows that when the indicator approaches or reverts down to a reading of 1 in a bull market, bullish momentum is likely to follow. As such, the SOPR oscillator can serve as a useful indicator for identifying local tops &amp; bottoms.
* When used in conjunction with other indicators and oscillators, the SOPR indicator may be able to confirm a market cycle top or bottom.

**What You Should Know:**

* Since hitting a local high of 1.21 in December 2020, the SOPR indicator (7-day moving average) has been in a downtrend.
* At the time of writing, BTC's SOPR indicator sits at 0.96, a level last seen in March 2020.
* With the SOPR indicator fast approaching a reading of 1, one could expect BTC to bounce higher in the days/weeks ahead.
* Note that in 2017 we saw the SOPR indicator mean revert down towards 1 while price consolidated. Shortly thereafter, price rallied meaningfully higher and resumed its macro uptrend.

### Bitcoin's Stock-to-Flow Ratio

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tz4v23yyg8171.png?width=3564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=542747c4982629b5bb11d35d4c87f3d96c650a92

  
**How To Read This Chart:**

* Much like gold and silver, we can consider BTC's circulating supply (stock) against its expected production of new supply (flow) to get a stock-to-flow ratio. 
* A high stock-to-flow ratio implies that a commodity is growing increasingly scarce and more valuable as a result.
* By overlaying BTC's price against its stock-to-flow ratio, one will find that BTC's price has trended alongside the ratio over the years.
* One will also find that BTC's price continues to diverge less and less from its stock-to-flow ratio, which is a 365-day average; when price trends above the stock-to-flow ratio, the divergence is positive (&gt;1) and thus BTC may be considered ""overbought.""
* The multi-coloured line denotes the number of days until Bitcoin's next halving, which is when the mining reward for a new block is cut in half. This reduction in new coins (flow) drives BTC's stock-to-flow ratio higher, implying that BTC is scarcer and thus more valuable. 

**What You Should Know:**

* Bitcoin is 1071 days out from its next halving, at which point its block reward will fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.
* BTC's current divergence is 0.35 (""oversold""), down from yesterday's reading of 0.38 and down from last week's reading of 0.44. The last time BTC was this oversold was in July 2017.
* Prior market cycle tops coincided with a divergence reading of 40.8 (June 2011), 9.8 (April 2013), 9.75 (December 2013), and 3.5 (December 2017).

### Ethereum's Logarithmic Regression Rainbow

https://preview.redd.it/4p9amvicg8171.png?width=3398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29578c5a1fe3d9fa5ff3721344e97ab6f7e618d2

**How To Read This Chart:**

* Using ETH’s historical price action, we can plot logarithmic regression trendlines that coincide with historical levels of support and resistance.
* These lines can be useful for navigating bull and bear market cycles, as well as for identifying critical levels of support and resistance.
* Do note that with each day that passes, ETH's logarithmic regression rainbow trends higher. This means the longer ETH can continue to trend higher to the next subsequent regression trendline, potentially the higher the market cycle top.

**What You Should Know:**

* At a current price of $2,618, ETH currently resides between Band 4 ($1,678) and Band 5 ($2,883).
* ETH's sell-off last week coincided with a backtest of band 4 ($1,678) support. If ETH can break through band 5 ($2,883) in the forthcoming days, we could see ETH press higher into 3Q.
* ETH would have to rally +10% to test resistance at $2,883 and would have to correct -36% to test support at $1,678.
* A move up to Band 8, which coincides with ETH’s previous market cycle top, would imply a $16,308 Ether and a +347.1% return from the current price.

### Bitcoin's +1 Yr. HODL Wave

*Processing img bt5681dgg8171...*

**How To Read This Chart:**

* BTC's +1 Yr. HODL Wave shows what percentage of coins in circulation haven't been moved in at least 1 year.
* When charted against BTC's price, one can identify trends that coincide with bull and bear market cycles. 
* Historically, a local top in the +1 Yr. HODL wave is congruent with the start of a new bull market. When the number of untouched coins begins to decline amid rapid price appreciation, one can be confident that a new bull market cycle is likely underway.
* When the downward slope of the HODL wave grows increasingly steeper, one can assume that selling pressure is beginning to increase and supply is likely to outpace demand. As such, a cycle top is presumably creeping closer.
* Prior to hitting a local high, a gradual increase in the +1 Yr. HODL wave signals that market participants are in ""accumulation mode.""

**What You Should Know:**

* BTC's current +1 Yr. HODL Wave reading sits at 54.4%, i.e. 54.4% of all coins in circulation haven't been moved in more than a year. This is down -9.0 percentage points from a local top of 63.4% set on September 9, 2020.
* Despite BTC's latest correction, the +1 Yr. HODL wave is little changed week-over-week. Last Monday's reading came in at 54.65%, only slightly higher than this week's reading of 54.4%. 
* On January 31, 2013, BTC's +1 Yr. HODL Wave hit a local high of 48.2% and the price of BTC was at $20.40. When BTC hit a cycle high of $1,158 on November 30, 2013, the +1 Yr. HODL Wave reading was at 38.8%. That is, over the course of 303 days, the number of coins that hadn't been moved in more than a year had fallen 9.4 percentage points while price appreciated +5,580%.
* On January 19, 2016, BTC's +1 Yr. HODL Wave hit a local high of 61.5% and the price of BTC was at $380. When BTC hit a cycle high of $19,660 on December 17, 2017, the HODL Wave reading was at 43.1%. That is, over the course of 698 days, BTC's HODL Wave fell -18.4 percentage points while price appreciated +5,073%.

### Bitcoin's 200W Moving Avg. Multiple

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9mk60a0ig8171.png?width=3568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=440ecfe0158007654dc4e7c76a1397896ebd772b

**How To Read This Chart:**

* **200W Moving Average:** A critical level of support used to determine an overall long-term market trend. The trendline measures the average price of BTC over the prior 200 weeks.
* **Moving Average Multiple:** The multiple with which BTC is trading at relative to its 200-week moving average. For example, a multiple of 4.0x means BTC is trading at 4x its 200-week moving average.

**What You Should Know:**

* In prior bull market cycles, BTC has traded as much as 10x - 15x its 200-week moving average prior to entering a bear market.
* BTC's 200-week moving average is 3.08x. That is, BTC is trading at 3.08x its 200-week moving average ($12,763), up from last week's multiple of 2.76x.
* Given today's 200-week moving average of $12,763, a 10x - 15x multiple would imply a BTC price of $127,630 - $191,445.
* BTC's 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 10.3X for the week of April 4, 2013. On April 9, 2013, BTC hit a cycle high of $259.
* BTC's 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 13.2X for the week of November 25, 2013, which coincided with a market cycle top of $1,158.
* BTC's 200-week moving average multiple hit a local high of 15.2X for the week of December 11, 2017. That same week, price hit a cycle high of $19,660.

### Bitcoin's Bull Market Weekly Support 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l866tjkkg8171.png?width=3402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aecbfeea46125efe3fd07463e435b625200cfbbf

**How To Read This Chart:**

* BTC's Bull Market Weekly Support tracks two critical levels of support that have acted as last lines of defense in prior bull market cycles: BTC's 20-week exponential moving average and 21-week simple moving average.
* In prior bull market cycles, BTC has mean reverted down to the 20W EMA and 21W SMA before bouncing and resuming its uptrend.
* When BTC breaks below both moving averages, the likelihood of BTC's bull market coming to an end is heightened.

**What You Should Know:**

* At a price of $39,250, BTC's 20-week exponential moving average is $45,209 and its 21-week simple moving average is $48,171.
* Currently, BTC is beneath the bull market support band for a second consecutive week. Given its historical relevance, a decisive close above both the 20W EMA and 21D SMA in the forthcoming weeks could serve as a massive tailwind for BTC if/when reclaimed. Until then, one could expect incremental bearish price action.
* A move down to BTC's 20-week exponential moving average would imply a -15.2% correction from current price.
* A drop down to BTC's 21-week simple moving average equates to a -22.7% drop from current levels.

### Bitcoin's Logarithmic Growth Curve

https://preview.redd.it/1tq9cf2pg8171.png?width=3404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a09b9d66712910c8dfdd0e0d21c7dc395498a84

**How To Read This Chart:**

* BTC's logarithmic growth curve consists of two sets of curved trendlines that have historically proven to be critical levels of support and resistance.
* While both lines point to price ranges whereby BTC is arguably ""overbought"" or ""oversold,"" they also represent a notable underlying property of BTC that can be found in social networks, technological innovations, pandemics, societies, and economics: exponential growth.

**What You Should Know:**

* BTC is a +114% to +181% move away from entering into ""overbought"" territory, which is currently between $84,114 and $110,129.
* BTC is a -42% to -56% move away from falling into ""oversold"" territory. This week's range is $17,368 - $22,740.
* At a current price of $39,250, BTC resides in the 42 percentile of the logarithmic growth curve's $17,368 - $110,129 range.

* A SOPR &gt; 1 means that the owners of spent outputs are in profit at the time of the transaction. Because a reading &lt; 1 means market participants would have to sell at a loss, few are willing to do so in the midst of a bull market.
* History shows that when the indicator approaches or reverts down to a reading of 1 in a bull market, bullish momentum is likely to follow. As such, the SOPR oscillator can serve as a useful indicator for identifying local tops &amp; bottoms.
* When used in conjunction with other indicators and oscillators, the SOPR indicator may be able to confirm a market cycle top or bottom.

**What You Should Know:**

* Since hitting a local high of 1.21 in December 2020, the SOPR indicator (7-day moving average) has been in a downtrend.
* At the time of writing, BTC's SOPR indicator sits at 0.96, a level last seen in March 2020.
* With the SOPR indicator fast approaching a reading of 1, one could expect BTC to bounce higher in the days/weeks ahead.
* Note that in 2017 we saw the SOPR indicator mean revert down towards 1 while price consolidated. Shortly thereafter, price rallied meaningfully higher and resumed its macro uptrend.

### Bitcoin's Stock-to-Flow Ratio

**How To Read This Chart:**

* Much like gold and silver, we can consider BTC's circulating supply (stock) against its expected production of new supply (flow) to get a stock-to-flow ratio. 
* A high stock-to-flow ratio implies that a commodity is growing increasingly scarce and more valuable as a result.
* By overlaying BTC's price against its stock-to-flow ratio, one will find that BTC's price has trended alongside the ratio over the years.
* One will also find that BTC's price continues to diverge less and less from its stock-to-flow ratio, which is a 365-day average; when price trends above the stock-to-flow ratio, the divergence is positive (&gt;1) and thus BTC may be considered ""overbought.""
* The multi-coloured line denotes the number of days until Bitcoin's next halving, which is when the mining reward for a new block is cut in half. This reduction in new coins (flow) drives BTC's stock-to-flow ratio higher, implying that BTC is scarcer and thus more valuable. 

**What You Should Know:**

* Bitcoin is 1071 days out from its next halving, at which point its block reward will fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.
* BTC's current divergence is 0.35 (""oversold""), down from yesterday's reading of 0.38 and down from last week's reading of 0.44. The last time BTC was this oversold was in July 2017.
* Prior market cycle tops coincided with a divergence reading of 40.8 (June 2011), 9.8 (April 2013), 9.75 (December 2013), and 3.5 (December 2017).

CryptoCurrency,Your Worst Crypto Enemy is You,"I am a pretty good poker player. Mostly low buy in ($10) Texas Hold Em tournaments. I make a little extra squeezing green that mostly goes into my crypto investments.

One good poker book (I read a lot) is titled “Your Worst Poker Enemy is You” The premise of the book is that if you are a long term loser in poker it’s 100% your fault.

This is a very important concept to grasp. I see posts on here that remind me of the delusional rants i often see on Poker sites.

The poker rants are usually of two varieties.

I am the unluckiest guy in the world.
This poker site is rigged 

They are both BS. And I see the same BS here...

Luck plays a role in every endeavor (especially poker) and some things are rigged but OVER THE LONG RUN your skill (or lack thereof) is the sole determinant of your level of success.

If you are doing badly long term. You are doing something wrong. These seem to be generally accepted successful strategies. If you aren’t doing this it’s your fault.

Research before you buy or sell
Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose
Look to HODL 
Get passive income
Take some profits off the top
DCA
If the landscape changes don’t get stuck in the way it was. (Especially in an emerging asset class like crypto)

Everyone has a bad beat story in poker. That hand that was yours and cruel fate robbed you of a boatload of cash...

And nobody cares about yours in poker or crypto.

One good poker book (I read a lot) is titled “Your Worst Poker Enemy is You” The premise of the book is that if you are a long term loser in poker it’s 100% your fault.

This is a very important concept to grasp. I see posts on here that remind me of the delusional rants i often see on Poker sites.

The poker rants are usually of two varieties.

I am the unluckiest guy in the world.
This poker site is rigged 

They are both BS. And I see the same BS here...

Luck plays a role in every endeavor (especially poker) and some things are rigged but OVER THE LONG RUN your skill (or lack thereof) is the sole determinant of your level of success.

If you are doing badly long term. You are doing something wrong. These seem to be generally accepted successful strategies. If you aren’t doing this it’s your fault.

Research before you buy or sell
Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose
Look to HODL 
Get passive income
Take some profits off the top
DCA
If the landscape changes don’t get stuck in the way it was. (Especially in an emerging asset class like crypto)

Everyone has a bad beat story in poker. That hand that was yours and cruel fate robbed you of a boatload of cash...

And nobody cares about yours in poker or crypto. If you aren’t doing well...suck it up...look at yourself and make the changes you need.",1523,30,1493

We are students, so we don't have income.. In fact, our traditional accounts (e.g. bank) are pretty much empty, everything is either cash or in a crypto exchange already. However, we can 'save up' here and there.. I'm sure plenty of you will relate. Here are some examples:

\- The market is red, I wish I had something to 'billy-in' with.. Well, my mom transferred me x money to buy the flight tickets to go back to uni. I bought them low cost, with cabin bag only.. saving up half of x. I send a message to a crypto friend of mine, 'Yo, I got some Billy and I was thinking Matic or Uni. Any thoughts?'

\- My father had to use my card to purchase something online. So he transferred me x. He made the purchase and some was left, he said to keep it.. At the same time I was eyeing a new crypto project that had a nice team, proper investors, good vision, active roadmap etc.. Well, you know what happened.

\- My friend was reimbursed x from an online clothing store.. at the same time, Cake was down to 8 USD. He texted me 'I got some Billy to buy cake with!'. lol

\- A barely-coiner friend of ours was given x cash by his father to offer us all a nice restaurant lunch. However, we were on a hike and by the time we got back to town, restaurants were closed, implying a much smaller expense.. My crypto friend I instinctively suggest to place the rest in Binance.. Billy syndrome, again.

By now it seems natural, and ironic, and kind of out of hand sometimes.. still, I'm sure it will be good memories in the future, when we'll have income. At least we don't ever panic sell, or buy tops. :D

Anyway, I'd love to hear other funny examples of this.

CryptoCurrency,Reminder - Dips are great for Tax-loss harvesting.,"It's even easier for crypto since they are not subject (in the US) to wash sale rules\*\*. If you have traded anything when we were peaking a few weeks ago - Most likely the tax consequences of that trade are a big chuck of the coin's current value now that we're down so much. One way to offset those costs is to just swap it out now for something else. Even if you just swap it right back - You'll lock in the loss to counter the previous gains as far as taxes are concerned. 

For example:

Bought $1000 worth of BTC for $30K in December. Swapped it for ETH @ $4200 in April - That is a capital gain of about $1000 based on the value of that BTC when you made the trade. You'll owe taxes of $2-300 for that gain. If you now trade that ETH for BTC at the rate of $2200 you'll offset that gain, pretty much to zero.

CryptoCurrency,"Coins that weathered the crash well, and does it mean anything?","I thought that a lot of coins were breaking free from just following bitcoin (especially ETH) but this crash makes it seem like that is not the case after all. But a few coins did OK, and some did a lot worse than most. Bitcoin lost about 50% from the recent ATH to the bottom of the crash. Most alts lost 50-75% from recent highs to the lowest point of the crash. But a few stood out. 

The big one I see is Celsius (CEL). It really didn't go down at all, just normal movement on a continued uptrend. What sets it apart, and is that a massively good sign like it seems to be? 

The Transfer Token (TTT) cruised right through the crash, not dipping at all and going up instead. I know basically nothing about this token but it's action has piqued my interest. 

BotXtoken (BOTX) seems to be ahead of the curve, crashing fast before the rest and then bouncing back pretty much all the way. It's a weird coin I know nothing about and only trades on one exchange that I also know nothing about. 

Zelwin (ZLW) seems to have been immune to the crash. It almost looks like a stablecoin but isn't. It trades on some fairly popular exchanges so I wonder what kept it safe?

Hellenic Coin (HNC) also went up despite everything else crashing. It's a privacy currency like Monero. Other privacy coins got hit though. I wonder why this one didn't (again, may be partially due to not being on very many exchanges so it's harder to trade).

YouCash (YOUC), a rewards token, seems to have not been affected. 

That's cruising through the top 300 coins on CMC. Everything else that isn't some kind of stablecoin seems to have followed bitcoin.

CryptoCurrency,Some banks are on the wrong side of history on cryptocurrencies,"""Banks and other financial institutions who still refuse to recognise major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, as a legitimate asset class are putting themselves on the wrong side of history.

The observation comes despite the cryptocurrency market shedding more than $1 trillion in a week after all-time highs, which have prompted some financial institutions to speak out on the likes of Bitcoin.

However, the world’s largest cryptocurrency advanced as much as 19% on Monday.

Bitcoin, amongst other digital tokens, has had a hugely impressive run over the last six months, so it’s not surprising that there’s a period of consolidation and short-term correction in such a hot market.

We can expect market turbulence of this nature to continue until it fully matures and there is even greater institutional investment.

But if you zoom out on the charts and take a look, they show that Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest cryptocurrencies, have consistently been on an upward trajectory over the longer-term – but no financial market ever moves up in a completely straight line, yet the upside direction is clear.

As such, I find it baffling that some banks have decided to refute the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies.

By doing so, they are not only placing themselves on the wrong side of history, but they’re not providing clients access to the potentially significant opportunities of key digital assets that could define the future.

Of course, cryptocurrencies are not for every client - but neither is any investment. Therefore, a refusal of one particular asset class seems somewhat peculiar.

The blistering pace of the digitalisation of economies and our lives means that from now on there will be a growing demand for digital, global, borderless money.

Indeed, digital currencies have already changed forever the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets.

They are becoming an integrated part of the mainstream financial system, which is evidenced by more and more Wall Street giants, social media platforms and multinationals, amongst others, becoming increasingly actively pro-crypto.

Last week, I said the U.S. Treasury Department’s new, stricter cryptocurrency rules underscore how the likes of Bitcoin are becoming increasingly mainstream.

I believe that this is recognition by those running the world’s largest economy that cryptocurrencies, in some form or another, are the future of money. The genie can't be put back in the bottle.

I believed it could be the first significant step towards global regulation.

It is inevitable as the market grows and matures. Proportionate regulation should be championed. It would help protect investors, shore-up the market, tackle criminality, and reduce the potential possibility of disrupting global financial stability, as well as offering a potential long-term economic boost to those countries that introduce it.

When everything from voting to entertainment is already digital, dismissing digital currencies in a digital era as part of a properly diversified portfolio, to my mind, seems a little archaic.""

CryptoCurrency,The ultimate guide to building up your nest egg and earn passive income from your crypto every month. (Updated),"I find it really satisfying to set a passive-income goal in the future (for example $4000 a month only from crypto staking, lending, trading). I have been using some of these services to increase my holdings with compound interest.

Even if you have a small portfolio you should definitely start**. Magic of compound interest + appreciating asset price will help you reach your own goal a lot quicker** and with a lower amount of capital than if you were to ignore it.

The best part is that you're usually earning it in kind, so even if the current USD value seems insignificant, I suppose you're not invested in anything you don't expect will increase in value, so every dollar this week will hopefully be worth way more. **Just a nice passive DCA basically.**

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|5%|1.5%|6%|6.1%|4%|3%|

1. All of these services are extremely reputable and work with and are backed by solid companies

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|4.5%|2.5%|5.05%|\-|4%|3.5%|

1. The best way right now is to partake in ETH2 staking APY is currently between 6-8%. If you have less than 32 ETH you should stake it on a reputable exchange like Kraken and Binance.
2. Another way is to do it is via rocket pool when it launches

**Important**: ETH 2 rewards will be locked till ETH2 hard launches. But you can still trade back your locked eth to normal eth by the respective pairs on the exchange

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|9.3%|6%|10%|12.5%|8%|7.25%|

1. You could use the services mentioned above or you can dip your toes in DEFI lending like Anchor protocol (over 20% APY on UST !), Compound protocol.
2. Liquidity providing is also a good option but you have to worry about slippage high, gas fees and impermanent loss. So I would only suggest LPing if you are more experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Earning yield on other coins:**

Some coins can be staked in your wallet custodially. Some can be staked on exchanges like Kraken and Binance. Please do not miss out on these rewards, they compound and will help you reach financial freedom quicker.

Note: some of the services I mentioned above are non-custodial. The ""not your keys not your crypto"" comes to mind. But I feel that the reward we are compensated for FAR outweighs the non-custodial aspect of the services.

Some questions I got:

**Q: What is the better way, staking through a wallet or through a DEX?**

A: Depends on what's easier for you personally. DEX has higher rates but more complicated to set up. CEFI is easier and just deposit and forget about it but fewer rates and centralized. It's up to you!

**Q: How much do you think you will need to have invested for a return of 4k a month?**

A: Depends on what coin you earning interest on. If it's a stable coin Around 400000 dollars If it is in Bitcoin it would be more like 1 million dollars worth.

**Q: What is binance savings?**

A: It is flexible savings on Binance, which supports a couple of dozens of coins, and takes seconds to activate.

I hope you find the guide helpful!",1621924774,"The ultimate guide to building up your nest egg and earn passive income from your crypto every month. (Updated)I find it really satisfying to set a passive-income goal in the future (for example $4000 a month only from crypto staking, lending, trading). I have been using some of these services to increase my holdings with compound interest.

Even if you have a small portfolio you should definitely start**. Magic of compound interest + appreciating asset price will help you reach your own goal a lot quicker** and with a lower amount of capital than if you were to ignore it.

The best part is that you're usually earning it in kind, so even if the current USD value seems insignificant, I suppose you're not invested in anything you don't expect will increase in value, so every dollar this week will hopefully be worth way more. **Just a nice passive DCA basically.**

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|5%|1.5%|6%|6.1%|4%|3%|

1. All of these services are extremely reputable and work with and are backed by solid companies

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|4.5%|2.5%|5.05%|\-|4%|3.5%|

1. The best way right now is to partake in ETH2 staking APY is currently between 6-8%. If you have less than 32 ETH you should stake it on a reputable exchange like Kraken and Binance.
2. Another way is to do it is via rocket pool when it launches

**Important**: ETH 2 rewards will be locked till ETH2 hard launches. But you can still trade back your locked eth to normal eth by the respective pairs on the exchange

&amp;#x200B;

* **How to earn a yield on stable coin:**

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|9.3%|6%|10%|12.5%|8%|7.25%|

1. You could use the services mentioned above or you can dip your toes in DEFI lending like Anchor protocol (over 20% APY on UST !), Compound protocol.
2. Liquidity providing is also a good option but you have to worry about slippage high, gas fees and impermanent loss. So I would only suggest LPing if you are more experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Earning yield on other coins:**

Some coins can be staked in your wallet custodially. Some can be staked on exchanges like Kraken and Binance. Please do not miss out on these rewards, they compound and will help you reach financial freedom quicker.

Note: some of the services I mentioned above are non-custodial. The ""not your keys not your crypto"" comes to mind. But I feel that the reward we are compensated for FAR outweighs the non-custodial aspect of the services.

Some questions I got:

**Q: What is the better way, staking through a wallet or through a DEX?**

A: Depends on what's easier for you personally. DEX has higher rates but more complicated to set up. CEFI is easier and just deposit and forget about it but fewer rates and centralized. It's up to you!

**Q: How much do you think you will need to have invested for a return of 4k a month?**

A: Depends on what coin you earning interest on. If it's a stable coin Around 400000 dollars If it is in Bitcoin it would be more like 1 million dollars worth.

**Q: What is binance savings?**

A: It is flexible savings on Binance, which supports a couple of dozens of coins, and takes seconds to activate.

CryptoCurrency,ALT projects you're in for the Long Haul,"Since the entire market has crashed and may or may not crash again depending on who you listen to. IMO it's a bear market so we'll see low prices for awhile. What UTR ALT coins have caught your eye and caused you to snatch up a bag while the price was cheap? What about this project interested you, and why do you see it lasting long term? 

I'm currently holding CKB as my UTR coin. CKB is like if BTC and ETH had a baby with all the positives increased and all the negatives fixed. 

Few reasons why I decided to include Nervos in my portfolio.

1) Interoperability right out of the gate, uses RISC-V as it's VM language so it's already prepped to work with any other language. Currently it is already fully compatible with ETH &amp; ETH 2.0, they even have a layer 2 rollup solution so 2.0 works without issues. BTC, ADA, EOS, TRON, &amp; DOT compatability all being developed in parallel with an expectation of being fully functional end of year. Due to this flexibility programs can be written on other ecosystems, then connected to the network without having to be rewritten at all. While still retaining their ability to control functionality across the network and all others it's on. 

2) Economic structure, CKBytes (native coin) is used both as currency and data storage, everything uses CKBytes. This makes the coin become a SOV, while also pushing devs to create smaller more efficient programs to conserve space. There is an annual issuance of coins to purposely create inflation so programs that take up space but don't provide much to the network lose value over time. This incentivizes the creators to sell their coins containing the program data so they can collect some type of funds from their project.

3) POW consensus and block size adjusts to network bandwidth to optimize throughput. Nervos developed an algorithm called Eaglesong to expand on the Nakamoto Consensus and push it past it's capabilities. They fixed the issues seen in BTC that could cause someone to act maliciously, while making sure the slow tx aspects were no longer an issue. It's a more efficient, more secure version of one of the best consensus we have in crypto.

4) No rising gas fees. Tx on Nervos are sent to the network fully packaged, everything is created on the client end. So all that needs to happen is for the network to verify, instead of having the network package the data causing congestion and pushing fees higher. Additionally Tx fees are calculated by CPU cycles vs data size, this helps to keeps fees low and similar. 

5) Top funded coin from VC's across all small/mid cap projects. Currently backed by China's BSC (I know ironic considering what's happening). Open sourced, and is being led by Crypto veterans who have worked on ETH in the early days helping it become what it is today.

I know I'll get some hate for this project being POW and others talking trash about Tx fees but 🤷🏻‍♂️ I like this project. I personally prefer POW vs POS but think both are completely suitable and different approaches to Crypto. As far as the Tx fees go if that's my biggest concern on this project then I'll take it, there's more + about this project to outweigh it.",1621923610,"ALT projects you're in for the Long HaulSince the entire market has crashed and may or may not crash again depending on who you listen to.

So, If I aim to spend between $20 to $30 dollar every month I know which is low but this is all I can afford right now. I wanted to know which coin would be better to hold for long term gains?

Any Advice will be Appreciated.",474,18,456

Now lets ramp it up even furthet.At 6.3 billion mcap one moon will be worth 100$,entering the top 25,finallyplayin with the big bois.

And if moons end up being worth 63 billion today it will overtake tether to become part of the big3.

I simply want to push whoever may read this into doing some research on the subject of Fibonacci Retracements and using technical indicators for educational purposes. Everyone has the ability to use bitcoin charts and make these retracements in order to assist you in making decisions, or simply just feel better. This is not financial advice, but a push for due diligence.

Fib Retracements are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur. This is especially helpful during volatile times in upward or downward trends.These retracements are a tool that traders use in order to predict macro and micro trends in the price action. Out of all the indicators that people throw out, Fibonacci levels are without a doubt my favorite to use when looking in the short term.

The reason I bring these tools up is because I keep seeing so many posts asking what will happen and how to know what is going on. I am in no way saying these indicators will allow you to predict the future, but if you do a little research, you will see Fibonacci levels are a very proven tool and can be combined with Moving Average lines and other indicators in order to provide a more detailed view of the market in a macro or micro sense.

 After starting on these videos I would suggest looking at different patterns such as head and shoulders, deadcat bounce etc.

CryptoCurrency,How to handle the bear market...,"Now that we've entered the crash, a couple tips on what to expect for new traders/hodlers.

1. Collapse of short-term support levels - this is complete - the Head and Shoulders top in BTC collapsed, and it crashed about as much as TA would predict (the neckline to the peak of the H&amp;S pattern).

2. Expect a ""dead cat bounce"" - likely what is going on right now. After shattering short-term support, the long-term uptrend support becomes the new support level. We just hit that level, which is why the bounce is happening.

3. Expect a re-test of the uptrend support. If it breaks through that level, there will likely be another significant crash in price. That's fairly common as bubbles deflate. 

4. Look for a relatively longer-term bottoming pattern. Basically, on the weekly charts, expect the new downtrend the gradually become shallower. Once that process starts, a bottom should gradually set in, followed by a more-or-less horizontal trading period. 

This general pattern is relatively predictable when a major asset bubble unwinds. Much beyond that is hard to predict, however, including when the market will reverse. Don't try to day trade unless you have lots of $$ and are very experienced. Chasing waterfalls is extremely dangerous. 

The best way to navigate all of this is to set yourself a budget, and DCA on the way down. Corrections like this take a few months to unwind, even if they unwind fairly quickly. 

If you have some experience with market corrections, you might divide your budget into 50% crypto and 50% fiat or stablecoin savings for next 1-2 months. Then start slowly trickling the stable savings into crypto once the downtrend starts to flatten out. 

Example: If your budget is 200/week, put 100/week into crypto and 100 into $$ savings for a month or two. Then increase to putting $250/week into crypto until you have  used up the extra cash. Then continue to DCA $200 into crypto moving forward. 

That approach should ensure you keep building your holdings, and minimize both FUD and FOMO longer term. It also insulates you against short-term unwinding volatility, in case this burst resolves more quickly.",1621911896,"How to handle the bear market...Now that we've entered the crash, a couple tips on what to expect for new traders/hodlers.

I plan on holding these long-term. However, I read about people buying alt-coins, sometimes for very small amounts of money, and in just a few months they’re a millionaire. To me, I’d rather throw $50-$100 at an altcoin than scratchoff tickets.

I have dreams, detailed dreams, but not very clear directions on how to get there, and desperation and somewhat of a time limit to escape into my own life.

Keeping all of my money in my bank savings wasn’t helping me too much, doesn’t grow much that way, without a job, wouldn’t last even a full year.

Being a wage slave is BS, it’s demeaning (obviously some jobs more than others) and destroys mental health even more, and because of BS “at-will” laws and BS politicians, not much can be done to save your job or improve conditions most of the time.

Gotta take life into your own hands, look how long it’s taking just to gef a $15 an hour minimum wage! We can’t rely on our government to better our lives! We should keep fighting for progress, but certainly can’t expect any real progress in our lifetime (or much more of our lives are gone).

I just want to get my wealth and therefore my freedom, not much real freedom in being a wage slave or a vagrant, and living off the grid, might be worse than being a wage slave!

I see other people getting rich quick, and I’m trying to jumpstart my life and have somewhat of a time limit until I’m suddenly faced with more hardship.

I don’t want to rely on my parents, or the government, or as a beggar, or on any employee, because that’s not real freedom or independence.

Today I woke up thinking “I’m too good for this demeaning service crap that pays less than COVID unemployment with an authoritarian boss and absurd observation and ratings on us.

I want to be, behind the scenes, doing something more, logistical, something to do with data? Not awkward unnatural social scripts graded down to the very word.

I don’t want to be forced to be overly fake friendly to customers for less than, or even an actual living income.

I don’t REALLY have anything to lose, in the grand scheme of things. 

I’m also thinking I need to diversify my investments more, despite being most bullish on ETH and ADA.

Easier to figure out what you want to do with your life when/if you don’t have to worry about not being able to afford rent and bills, and far too much of society has just accepted being a paycheck or two away from homelessness (and losing healthcare) as acceptable.

I want to be able to afford private healthcare.,"I want to earn enough money so in future, my family can seek medical help at private hospitals, instead of public hospitals. For a context: the bills incurred at public hospitals are heavily subsidised by the government. In return, there tends to be long waits and you may not get priority. Those who wealthier can choose to seek medical treatment at public hospitals where it's relatively faster but extremely expensive.

I won't bore y'all with the specific details. In short: public hospital = long waits and delays. My grandfather has been hospitalised for 2.5 weeks with bleeding in his brain. 

It's different in private hospitals. In public hospitals, you're patients. In private hospitals, you're clients.

I'm tearing up as I write this post. I'm feeling a mix of anxiety, frustration, anger (at myself for not being able to give my loved ones the best), disappointment (in the public healthcare system) and fear (for losing my loved one). At the same time, I feel a very strong urge to up my game and give my family the best. They deserve the best. I WANT TO BE RICH. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD PRIVATE HEALTHCARE. 

I'm writing this post to vent my feelings and hopefully to motivate those on the sidelines to start taking charge of their wealth. I believe I'm not the only want here who wants to be rich to improve their quality of living. I HOPE ALL OF US WILL ACHIEVE OUR GOALS.

Turns out this morning was the corner and the good news is an entirely new, bullish narrative being pushed by powerful public figures and institutions that bought the dip. And funny enough, the reddit chicken littles are no longer screaming that the sky is falling. What a difference a weekend makes!

So in addition to beautiful green and 30-100% gains across the board, here's a few snippets from this Monday's hype cycle:

* Goldman Sachs thinks Ethereum is like Amazon for data
* Ray Dalio bought the dip
* Michael Saylor and Elon Musk met with miners to discuss clean energy and form the Bitcoin Miners Council to promote energy transparency and sustainability
* Whales took 122.5K Bitcoin from weak hands like they usually do

Remember that news cycles change fast and powerful people have the ability to temporarily dictate the media narrative.

CryptoCurrency,"My thoughts, as a (mostly silent) veteran","It is hard to admit but most of the money that drove this and past bull runs was stupid money chasing 'riches'. It is easy to identify: 

Are you hearing people at the grocery store talking about crypto and getting rich? Are alts pumping like crazy every day? Are there a bunch of projects out there promising to change the future of the world? Do those projects have a market cap commensurate with having already delivered on their promises, even though they have had no huge impact on 'mainstream' society? Are uninformed relatives asking you about your crypto positions again, even though they had no interest for the years in between bull runs? Has Nano recently pumped (jk)? 

My point is, when you really think about it, it is easy to identify when greed has taken over the market. Greed builds over a long period of time (months to years) and, once shattered, does not make an immediate recovery, it must rebuild once people have gone through their stages of grief and had a chance to reset their stance towards the object (crypto), which takes time.

Given recent events, I believe the greed has been shattered for too many people for the market to make a short-term recovery. Best of luck but beware of the first major dead-cat bounce after a 50% reversion, it looks and feels like everything is going back normal. I'd prefer to be wrong but the huge amount of short-term optimism around here after an event of this magnitude is only further evidence to me of how detached from reality (some) people have become during the bull run.

Let's dive in.

# 2017/2018

I don't need to remind most of you, we all had our soft parts in the same vice in 2018 and I don't remember seeing the stock-to-flow model being shown off that much. I don't recall the vets from Pre-2017 warning us too about anything. 

In fact, what I remember vividly was a lot of posts saying, ""hodl, it's going to $100k!"" - I guess things don't change much in that regard.

I don't blame the pre 2017 guys, a lot of them basically became millionaires that year and encountered life changing wealth. They were too busy already spending the money in their minds, they didn't have time to warn the noobs, and perhaps I'm naive, but I like to think that a few wanted us to 'make it' as well.

In any case, most of us learned the hard way about the model and spent the bear market watching it all play out, waiting and waiting to see if Bitcoins magic halvening feature would kickstart another bubble.

When that happened, it confirmed for many of us that we need to watch closely and wait for that huge run up and sell. We told ourselves, ""this time I'll get out closer to the top!"" 

Enter the argument for a 'supercycle.'

# Supercycle

The idea is that, wait for it, ""this time it's different."" The idea is that this time there won't be a clearly defined peak and the price of BTC will just keep climbing and climbing to what you would never expect (honestly, this is how these guys talk about it, go watch some YT videos or jump on Twitter). 

What this idea does is it starts to confuse the traders who are waiting for another top and for things to play out like they did before, and it also entrances them with the idea that this cycle they can make even more money.

I suppose there is a bit of game theory at work here as well; **a group of traders becomes aware that most of the other traders know what a BTC peak will look like, so they invent some idea that will ensure they have time to exit.**

\----

Perhaps this is a bit of a cynical post, but I felt I had to say it because many of the people trumpeting this 'supercycle' idea don't give a shit if you or I make it.

It's in their financial interests to make sure they can sell $4k - $64k bull runs before you or I do, and an easy way to make moves like that in the age where everyone knows about models and patterns that BTC follows is to just convince us that this time the cycle won't be the same because this time it's a ""supercycle.""

I'm sure we all have loved ones that we want to be a part of this gold mine that is crypto, what is your approach to similar situations? Do you beg and plead? Make a gift investment? (I did this for my aunt, not bc she was uninterested but bc I knew she'd have trouble understanding the tech) 

TLDR; I'm interested to hear your thoughts on the polarizing topic of crypto currency when it comes to encouraging skeptical friends and family to invest.",1334,153,1181

CryptoCurrency,Was there any regulations prohibiting coinbase employees from purchasing coins they knew were being added?,"Apologies ahead of time for any grammatical errors (typing on mobile). 

Ive been in and out of crypto since coinbase only had a few coins listed on their exchange.

We all knew they were going to add more, but we never knew what coins specifically. Clearly the employees (or at least executive level employees) knew which coins were going to be listed before the public.

My question is, was there anything legally stopping those employees from investing in those coins prior to be listed in coinbase (similar to insider trading)?

I ask because we already see the elons and cubans of the world manipulating their favorite coins but what is stopping companies from doing the same?

Perfect example, there are several insurance companies trying to enter the space. If an insurance company says ""we'll insure algo, but not ada"" the entire company/employees can load up on algo way before the product launches. 

I can see a time frame where this will be very lucrative for a select few (i.e the entire insurance company) but will ultimately bring serious government regulations because of the attention it draws.

CryptoCurrency,Moon Mining Question for You All,"So Ive seen a lot of posts about mining moons lately and some of you have an abundance of the crypto so you must be doing something right! So I assume moon mining can only be done on a moon. But how do the mining rights work for the mine? If there is a moon mine on the moon, and I fly there and am the first to claim it, is the moon mine mine? Once I have it, in terms of naming conventions, do I call it simply a ‘mine’ mine because the mine is on the moon (so inherently it’s a moon mine)? So then the real question is: is the ‘mine’ mine mine?",1621902537,"Moon Mining Question for You AllSo Ive seen a lot of posts about mining moons lately and some of you have an abundance of the crypto so you must be doing something right!

CryptoCurrency,Setting up reoccurring purchases (crypto beginner),"Hello all! 

I’m new in the Cryptocurrency space and I’ve decided to start investing in a few coins (I can post what I’m interested in if anyone would be interested!) My dilemma is I know Coinbase has some hefty transaction fees so I wanted to know if it was more cost effective to set up my reoccurring purchase as a lump sum in a stablecoin (say DAI). 

My thought is I would limit the amount of transaction fees I’m paying but on the other hand I feel like it might also be better to just buy the coins I like.

Any thoughts are appreciated and I’m very excited to start my journey into cryptocurrency! Thanks!",1621902522,"Setting up reoccurring purchases (crypto beginner)Hello all!

CryptoCurrency,I don't understand this anymore....," 

Elon Musk once said  that Tesla will no longer accept bitcoin because of the environmental concerns. 

The mining leaves a ***significant*** **carbon** ***footprint.***

According to this metrics [https://cbeci.org/mining\_map](https://cbeci.org/mining_map)

more then 65% of Bitcoin mining hash rate located in one country( china)

What does it means?

That means that all the hardware that runs and  maintenance the bitcoin blockchain is not evenly spread out thru the world making it vulnerable to one political regime  (looses decentralisation in some sense) And of course lets not forget the «carbon neutral» narrative. China is one of the greatest polluter in the world. China has a totalitarian regime with worst human rights conditions. When china one day will decide to completely ban mining (i mean one day it will happen eventually right?)and hash rate will drop dramatically , bitcoin will crush to zero of value.

Satoshi created the first open sourced decentralized Cryptocurrency, and Vitalik came along to create what we see as the largest open sourced decentralized software platform.  Ethereum. and it's beautiful. 

It's adapting to become better faster than any centralized system we ever had in the tech world.  Even adapting faster than google did when it was first created.  

Vitalek had a vision just like Satoshi did, and look at the power of the people. All the wonderful things he let us do with it because he kept it open sourced.   He did the exact opposite of what a centralized, greedy, information hoarding, profiteering corporation would do.  He laid it out, and basically  said..

 *Here...this is for everyone. Build off it, make it grow, it's yours, it belongs to everyone now*

And we did.   We did exactly that.  Now it's unstoppable.  Nobody can ban this massive network.  It will just keep growing and growing and growing and hopefully one day people will leave centralized big tech services like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube and create their own massive media network.

TL:DR = Too Long Didn't Read - will have a brief explanation of the post.

Bull Run = A prolonged period of an uptrend in price.

Bear Market = A prolonged period of a downtrend in price.

FOMO = Fear Of Missing Out - when you buy while the price is near or at its peak thinking it will continue to climb.

FUD = Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt - when you panic sell because the price is dropping.

DD = Due Diligence - doing your own research on a project.

DeFi = Decentralized Finance - what crypto is meant to be, not tied to a bank or government.

HODL = Hold On for Dear Life - never sell, ever. Also know as ""hold"".

ATH = All Time High - the highest a price has been.

Dip = when the price of a coin drops but bounces back.

BTFD = Buy The F\*\*\*ing Dip - buy while the price is low (nobody truly knows if it's a dip)

Correction = when the price of a coin drops after an upward trend.",1621900039,"For newcomers to the sub:

CryptoCurrency,CreamPYE - The Future of Crypto,"Hello Crypto Enthusiasts,

I would like to share a little bit about a new crypto that I have been bullish on recently, CreamPYE.

The CreamPYE team has established several lofty goals upon the launch of their new token and I believe the team has the experience and expertise to achieve them.

Below are just some of the upcoming projects that the CreamPYE team has in store for us.

\*PYEChart - A new crypto tracking application that will offer the most accurate data, charts, UI and overall will deliver a better user experience than anything that is currently available

\*PYEWallet - A one stop shop for all your crypto wallet needs. PYEWallet will support all coins and tokens with additional functionality not currently offered by most competitors

\*PYESwap CEXDEX - This will revolutionize the way DEX exchanges are done and will offer an affordable alternative to paying exorbitant fees on other exchanges

\*PYE NFT Marketplace - A full-featured NFT marketplace with a focus on engagement and experience as well as providing more utility to creators than any other marketplace currently available

All of these tools and services will be integrated with one another for a world class user experience and will really help with normalizing crypto for the average consumer

Below are some of the milestones already achieved by the team and community

\*Already donated $290k (and growing) to charity which gets funded from the dedicated charity wallet where 0.1% of all transactions go

\*Over 17k holders of PYE

\*CreamPYE listed on multiple exchanges already (CoinGecko, Probit, and Whitebit) and more on the way

As someone who has been closely following the team for the past few weeks since CreamPYE's launch I have really appreciated the transparency, communication, and overall emphasis on the community that the team has conveyed. Their entire tokenomics structure was designed around providing long term value and even passive income. Five percent of all transactions are distributed to existing holders of the token on a pro rata basis, this is where the passive income aspect comes from. My own anecdotal experience with this feature so far has increased the count of tokens in my wallet by over 10% in just 3 weeks. Even if the value of the token remains flat you would still receive multiple times your original investment over longer periods of time through this feature alone.

All of these tools and services will be integrated with one another for a world class user experience and will really help with normalizing crypto for the average consumer

Below are some of the milestones already achieved by the team and community

\*Already donated $290k (and growing) to charity which gets funded from the dedicated charity wallet where 0.1% of all transactions go

\*Over 17k holders of PYE

\*CreamPYE listed on multiple exchanges already (CoinGecko, Probit, and Whitebit) and more on the way

As someone who has been closely following the team for the past few weeks since CreamPYE's launch I have really appreciated the transparency, communication, and overall emphasis on the community that the team has conveyed. Their entire tokenomics structure was designed around providing long term value and even passive income. Five percent of all transactions are distributed to existing holders of the token on a pro rata basis, this is where the passive income aspect comes from. My own anecdotal experience with this feature so far has increased the count of tokens in my wallet by over 10% in just 3 weeks. Even if the value of the token remains flat you would still receive multiple times your original investment over longer periods of time through this feature alone.

CryptoCurrency,Staking and long-hold retirement strategy,"In 2020 I liquidated my stocks (besides 401k) and started investing into crypto. Staking was one of the reasons why.

Take Cardano for example. If you simply treat ADA like a stock and hold for 10-20+ years you can expect to earn ~5% back each year (in ada). ADA staking compounds after every epoch (5 days) and you get staking rewards at every epoch. 

If you staked 7300 ADA today (gaining 1 full ada at first epoch) and never invested in ada again you would have 19,837 ADA in 20 years because of compound staking. You would then be staking 19837 ADA making ~14 ADA every 5 days. If you continued not to pull or invested into the wallet for another 10 years you would be staking 32,700 ADA, and gaining ~23 ADA every 5 days. Now picture investing 5% yearly income to bolster staking rewards, what would that look like to you?

What price do you think ADA will be in 10 years, what about 20-30 years? Lets look at current market caps:

Current Market Caps/ Current Price:
BTC: ~700B / ~$37.5k
ETH: ~287B /~$2.5k
ADA: ~47B / ~$1.47
ALGO: ~2.9B / ~$0.95

ETH price with BTCs cap: $6k

ADA price with BTCs cap: $21.91
ADA price with ETHs cap: $8.95

ALGO price with ETHs cap: $93 
ALGO price with ADAs cap: $15.42

See market cap info here: thecoinperspective.com

Ultimately, it is exciting that ADA is beginning to be traded as a currency. Used as a utility and not just a store of wealth. If ADA was accepted worldwide I would gladly get paid in it (an appreciating asset).

My retirement strategy is to continue contributing to a 401k. DCA monthly into projects like Cardano, Algo, or ETH to gain staking rewards and BTC as a store of wealth.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Point of Work (PoW):\*\*

Miners use computing power (GPUs) to solve equations to reach consensus. Miners are rewarded for being the first to solve the equation. Usually miners can have an incentive to sell the coin reward to buy more hardware or reinvest the coin into another speculation coin. Miners want upgrades that help make more in mining rewards and transaction fees.

Ex: Bitcoin, Ravencoin, Litecoin

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Point of Stake (PoS):\*\*

Stakers use their stake (coins) to reach consensus. Stake holders are rewarded by being chosen based on their stake. Stakers have incentive to hold their coin reward to earn more stake reward (compounding). Stakers want upgrades that help to grow the value of their coins.

CryptoCurrency,BTC miners closed door meeting organised by Twitter manipulator billionaires - this might not be a good idea.,"I know that you all love Saylor right now, and he is advocating hard on BTC but let's not forget the leassons learned from Elon and generally that these people are ruthless and have their own agendas. This is my opinion on the subject and mostly a call to discussion.

**Why should this meeting have been open to the public (not in terms of participation but of discussion/minutes)? Miners are after all for-profit private companies.**

Because this directly affects and is related to the bitcoin network. It is against the open source and decentralised ethos of the project and sets a bad precedent. I believe that back room involvement of billionaires acting as regulators - with the public's blessing - is definitely a slippery slope and can only have a positive impact on the short to medium term price movement (if at all).

As a final note, members of the bitcoin industry, including major miners and developers were set to meet in California in June 2016. This was a closed door social event and in order to protect the ethos of the project the following statement was issued:

*Participants recognize that because bitcoin consensus rules are decided by the users based on the software the choose to run, so proposed changes must be discussed in public with input from the whole bitcoin community. For these reasons, there will be no agreements or roundtable consensus coming out this event.*

While the recent closed door meeting is indeed of different nature, **having two billionaire Twitter manipulators in the middle of it begs a lot of questions and is problematic.** Don't forget, miners get to influence dev and vice versa.

CryptoCurrency,What Is The Best System / Financial Model For Profit Taking?,"As many of us realized this past week, taking gains is important.

Having ridden the 2017 Bull market up and down, I'd prefer not to do that again.

I thought I'd be able to be rational this time around but this latest crash made me realize that you have to have a numeric system that instructs you to take profits at certain levels when price targets are met. If you leave it to your gut feeling, you won't be able to pull the trigger when needed and will ride the crash down to the bottom.

One idea I am modeling in Excel right now is take your average buy price and sell 1% for every 10% the price appreciates. For every 10% the price goes up, add 1% to your sell %.

So for example let's say your average cost for a coin is $100.

Price goes up 10% so at $110, you'd sell 1% of your holdings.

Price goes up another 10%, so at $121, you'd sell 2% of your holdings.

Price goes up again 10%, so at $133.1, you'd sell 3% of your holdings.

You keep doing this until you get your principal back.

In the above example, this would happen when the price goes up 185% (so $285). If you followed the above formula of profit-taking, by the time the price got up to $285, you'd have taken your principal of $100 out in profit, so even if it crashed, you'd be okay.

Obviously, you can tweak those numbers to take more or less profit out depending on your risk tolerance. 

I am still not sure what the best equation for taking profit out is. I suspect some Nobel prize-winning economists have determined the perfect formula. 

Was curious what people advise or what your system is?",1621897619,"What Is The Best System / Financial Model For Profit Taking?As many of us realized this past week, taking gains is important.

CryptoCurrency,Binance Staking | Interest reward vs blockchain securement reward,"Hi

I posted this in the binance reddit sub but didnt get any response. I have been trying to figure this out but cannot get a conclusive answer to staking rewards specifically for the following 3 coins. DOT, MATIC AND ETH. I know Kraken explains in their FAQ that staking rewards are NOT like interest, the PoS system is used to secure the blockchain \[source: [https://blog.kraken.com/post/4736/what-is-staking-frequently-asked-questions-about-a-new-way-to-earn-crypto/](https://blog.kraken.com/post/4736/what-is-staking-frequently-asked-questions-about-a-new-way-to-earn-crypto/) \]. I wanted to know staking the above mentioned 3 coins, at binance, is it the same thing?

Its just the terminology, APY (Annual Percentage Yield) that concerns me.

If someone can explain or shed more light on this, I would really appreciate it!

CryptoCurrency,Noob's perspective: crypto won't catch on until it's simpler for noobs CMV,"**tl;dr it's too fucking complicated. Even with help from people on reddit and discord I still have yet to be able to buy any of this stupid ass meme coin, which 10x'ed while I tried to figure it out**

I saw a meme coin I wanted to buy. Thought I'd throw 1k at it for fun. I proceeded to spend 2 full days, 16 hours or so trying to figure out how to buy it, and I'm more confused than when I started. 

You can only buy the coin on pancakeswap. Try to make an account there. You don't actually make an account, you just need to connect to a wallet. Ok so I make a metamask wallet. I guess you have to buy something on metamask, then send it over. I create a metamask wallet, but they're not linked (I'm on the metamask chrome extension). That version isn't available on my version of pancakeswap. So I download the Metamask iOS app. connect to pancakeswap through walletconnect. Ok ready to send some money to pancakeswap. Nope, gotta first update versions on pancakeswap, V1 doesn't have this coin. Do that, now I'm ready to send some money to pancakeswap. Nope, you can't just do that, I need BNB. I have to send BNB to metamask, and I actually have to make a Binance account. Make a Binance account. The conversion rate for USDT/CAD is 1.30 CAD+, so I'm losing 10%+ just on this initial transaction. Turns out I can make a Newton account and buy XLM, send that to Binance, swap for BNB, send that to metamask- wait no shit I have to connect my metamask to the Binance smart chain. I have to swap that BNB on the Binance smart chain for BNB on the ethereum network? then send to metamask. No I do that in metamask. BEP20 vs BEP2? is that what I'm switching? 

At this point I just gave up. Not to mention the fact that at the end of it all, I end up having to use my credit card anyways, so there's a $10 cash advance fee for buying through my credit card, plus the guy on the phone at my bank said there are ""probably more fees, he doesn't know what/ how much they'll be,"" but can transfer me to his manager if I want to hold? no thanks. Not to mention I now have 4 new accounts, 4 passwords, and 4 strings of text to remember and NEVER share with anyone but also need to store it in 3 separate locations, and also I need a cold wallet ($150+) to protect my money from scammers because hot wallets can be hacked. When I post on reddit asking for help, I straight up get 10+ DMs PER POST from people claiming to be official support for pancakeswap, metamask, etc. Not to mention that even if I were able to buy, it's one of the riskiest 'investments' out there. 

I'm not a tech genius (obviously), but I'm in my 20s and I'm ok for my age on a computer. When I try to talk to my friends about investing, they're intimidated and confused by what a brokerage account is and what the S&amp;P 500 is. I can only imagine their horror trying to do any of this. Don't even get me started on my Gen X parents, who get mad at you when you suggest to them that they should remember their email password.

CryptoCurrency,The Difference between a 90% and 95% crash IF you come in and buy more at the crash is much bigger than you think.,"&amp;#x200B;

This is a response to this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/njzxy9/the\_difference\_between\_a\_90\_crash\_and\_a\_95\_crash/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/njzxy9/the_difference_between_a_90_crash_and_a_95_crash/)

This was one view, now let me present a different view. 

Suppose you get a loss - but then immediately double your position by buying more.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Before:  You do not change your position.

After:  You bought more - and doubled your position based on the price after the crash.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Before: A 50% loss takes a 100% gain to recover your money.

After: A 50% loss now takes a 50% gain to recover your money

&amp;#x200B;

Before: A 75% crash takes a 300% gain to recover your money.

After: A 75% crash takes a 150% gain to recover your money.

&amp;#x200B;

Before: An 80% crash takes a 400% gain to recover your money.

After: An 80% crash takes a 200% gain to recover your money.

&amp;#x200B;

Before: A 90% crash takes a 900% gain to recover your money.

After: A 90% crash takes a 450% gain to recover your money.

&amp;#x200B;

Before: A 95% crash takes a 1900% gain to recover your money.

After: A 95% crash takes a 950% gain to recover your money.

&amp;#x200B;

Before: A 98% crash takes a 4900% gain to recover your money.

After: A 98% crash takes a 2450% gain to recover your money.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you double your position after the crash you get to reduce your needed recovery percentage by half

&amp;#x200B;

But hold on.

If you triple your position after the crash you get to reduce your needed recovery percentage by two thirds.

If you quadruple your position after the crash you get to reduce your needed recovery percentage by three quarters.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't assume that your losses are permanent.  They will be if you never put another dime again.",1621895456,"The Difference between a 90% and 95% crash IF you come in and buy more at the crash is much bigger than you think.&amp;#x200B;

Before: A 98% crash takes a 4900% gain to recover your money.

After: A 98% crash takes a 2450% gain to recover your money.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you double your position after the crash you get to reduce your needed recovery percentage by half

&amp;#x200B;

But hold on.

If you triple your position after the crash you get to reduce your needed recovery percentage by two thirds.

If you quadruple your position after the crash you get to reduce your needed recovery percentage by three quarters.

Don't assume that your losses are permanent.  They will be if you never put another dime again.",2012,114,1898

CryptoCurrency,X2P - is it legit?,"Hi everyone!
New to the crypto game and been doing some research on new coins I can buy for cheap and hold for a few years in hopes of getting some substantial returns... So I came across X2P.
Reading through their white paper, they claim they are looking to 1) Reinvent BSC, 2) create a faster and low-fee system for investments (their own app), 3) allow more access to Crypto investment and ""fun"" (whatever that means)

The coin sits now at $0.00000003 and they distribute 10% transaction fees to all holders.

While the price seems very appealing, I am hesitant to buy because I'm not sure their objectives make sense. And I have to admit, the redistribution of fees sounds a bit like a Pyramid scheme.

Anyone knows about this or has any more information outside of what the developers claim?

Thanks!

- More online shops to accept doge (nothing to do with the devs)

CryptoCurrency,Was this crash predicted by memes?: Deep lore and pseudo-analysis of the Crypto War 2 by the comeback of Bogdanoff Twins into the GME Saga.,"*^(This is just a chill meme speculative conversation about this crazy crypto-stock season, dont take to seriously. English isn't my native language, me gustan crayones señor.)*

**Everything start** when I watched this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5QlSgq7lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5QlSgq7lg)

The video is just from the great Bizonacci, back in the **Crypto War I**, while Korea baned BTC exactly as China do it now. In other videos they mentioned the plan **CRAB-17: Bogdanoff Twins top secret plans for Bitcoin.**

*Processing img 2nfq2xbo44171...*

Bogdanoff Twins are an onmipresent all-powerfull meme twins that can manipulate stock market or *The Stock Realm*.

[One twin obliterating BTC.](https://preview.redd.it/3xysvckl64171.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d13b19f1b1394d1bad0922eb22ad4e20181d1b19)

&gt;*Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff are ancient organisms originally discovered in a secret alien lab beneath France, trapped in stasis.*

To here, deep memes from internet are my passion, like any reddit user. I searched more in the wiki, and I founded the CRAB-17 plan. Ok, **CRAB-17 sounds quite similar as COVID-19**, but lets just say: *I am a conspiracionist and I like X-Files, so is just my imagination playing UNO with myself*.

But what about the plan:

[plan posted by random user with details, back in jun-2018 in tradingview.com](https://preview.redd.it/0uvh4dma54171.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb86b5c3363ed92d58089736edae9401c4b23183)

what make me crazy is what the graph says:

* Twins push BTC to 50K by dec-2018.
* EVERYONE EXPECTS 100K. *The euphoria is electrifyng...*
* Bogdanoff makes the call.
* BTC dumped 10K, 2 years bears.
* MEME WEDGE BREAKS DOWN. Everyone goes short o plans short throwback.
* Bogdanoff / Illuminati buy the dip.

**how is possible watch exactly the same graph pattern, actors that looks like exactly as Ellen Mask and the new china politics, plus the** ***meme*** (**coin) that rise and breaks down**. He says the closes prices 50K that was totally suitable for BTC some weeks ago.

[similar patterns induced by Bogdanoff Twins, today BTC\/USD traderview-binance](https://preview.redd.it/feyuhapu64171.png?width=867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c7dcdeb40c11d23fe32e96e987573c73c00b6e0)

This is just part of what I found: ***the wiki and Bizonacci are not conected***, but have the same deep level of lore:

&gt;*The Bogdanoff twins hold dominion over the Stock Realm. Boris sets out to the Stock Realm in pursuit of Sminem, who* ***offers to show him the secrets of his past when Boris lost the memories*** *of his nuclear origins in the late 1990s.* ***The final battle between Boris and the Bogdanoff twins is widely regarded as one of the all-time high***  *points of the manga and of the franchise in general, being the first time we catch a glimpse of* ***Boris' legendary*** ***RDS-46 Maximum Output*** ***form.***

&amp;#x200B;

[RDS-46 Boris from FANDOM wiki](https://preview.redd.it/4f80awl474171.png?width=274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3187803251b2d32d6c13e948b69be7128b2495fa)

Who is Boris? well, that is unknow to me, but I represent him as the ''savior'' in this saga, but IRL is *The Hive* (or reddit coop mind from any sub). Why? *Because Boris' legendary* *RDS-46 Maximum Output* *form sound as* ***Reddit right now crashing all, like the most powerfull form of a socialmedia: the hive mindset.***

# The best and high quality of non-sense conspiratorial fud by me

Basically, the BorisLover456 and Bizonacci suspect something that we don't know, but is something that probably ***is kind of mechanism to extract money from stock-crypt*****o**. Like, they know how do it in stock, but can work on crypto assets? Since I watched the *Textbook Wyckoff Distribution Exposed!* from  [uncomplication](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRsAEo9tcSqPnPdcgYFCbog) channel, predicting the crash 4 weeks ago, I think we were in the middle of kind of experimental crypto market technique (**what? haha WHAT?**).

# So just a few catchy points (TL;DR):

* Bizonacci says Boy Sminem fight vs the Twins back in 2017, and he won, **but they are still alive**  ([https://youtu.be/-5OeVSiisLU](https://youtu.be/-5OeVSiisLU)). In the future, he will need bring back Boris to fight them again.
* Boy Sminem (BTC power carrier) bring Boris this time to fight, after he lost the memory (STOCK power carrier). *Boris was probably obliterated back in the stock naked short killing-companies*.
* They fight vs The Bogdanoff Twins, who already manipulate the market years ago (CryptoWar I - 2017). Remember that the Twins can control the Stock Realm just with a call (twitt?), ***for real,*** ***who tf is the other twin?***
* They win the fight vs B1NGU5, thats mean, ''GME moass happened''. *Spicy baby!* The End of GME with the defeat of B1NGU5 (?) will bring the Twins (Ellen and ?) again to battle in the Stock Realm (Crypto War II, 2021).
* We are in the actual fight in the lore.
* As Borislover456 writed: *the twins will perish*, mostly because all the markets stay together, ***metaphorically speaking***.

**I support all this theory based on memes. But, I can feel it, there is something real.** Korea/China Bans, Twins or FUD influencers, WallStreet, Reddit, a Market War, 2017 or 2021, devil cats...  what if the detonate of both crash behaviors is the same? 1313

(*this is mostly some humor for these last days, I know all we have dreams to reach, and the crypto is always a path to do it: you will; we will).* 

# Good week! 

# 再见 !

PS: moderatos please obliterate my post if break some rule. I am read the rules but I decided post it anyway bc today I felt powerful.",1621893649,"Was this crash predicted by memes?: Deep lore and pseudo-analysis of the Crypto War 2 by the comeback of Bogdanoff Twins into the GME Saga.*^(This is just a chill meme speculative conversation about this crazy crypto-stock season, dont take to seriously. English isn't my native language, me gustan crayones señor.)*

**Everything start** when I watched this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5QlSgq7lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5QlSgq7lg)

The video is just from the great Bizonacci, back in the **Crypto War I**, while Korea baned BTC exactly as China do it now. In other videos they mentioned the plan **CRAB-17: Bogdanoff Twins top secret plans for Bitcoin.**

*Processing img 2nfq2xbo44171...*

Bogdanoff Twins are an onmipresent all-powerfull meme twins that can manipulate stock market or *The Stock Realm*.

[One twin obliterating BTC.](https://preview.redd.it/3xysvckl64171.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d13b19f1b1394d1bad0922eb22ad4e20181d1b19)

&gt;*Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff are ancient organisms originally discovered in a secret alien lab beneath France, trapped in stasis.*

To here, deep memes from internet are my passion, like any reddit user. I searched more in the wiki, and I founded the CRAB-17 plan. Ok, **CRAB-17 sounds quite similar as COVID-19**, but lets just say: *I am a conspiracionist and I like X-Files, so is just my imagination playing UNO with myself*.

But what about the plan:

[plan posted by random user with details, back in jun-2018 in tradingview.com](https://preview.redd.it/0uvh4dma54171.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb86b5c3363ed92d58089736edae9401c4b23183)

what make me crazy is what the graph says:

* Twins push BTC to 50K by dec-2018.
* EVERYONE EXPECTS 100K. *The euphoria is electrifyng...*
* Bogdanoff makes the call.
* BTC dumped 10K, 2 years bears.
* MEME WEDGE BREAKS DOWN. Everyone goes short o plans short throwback.
* Bogdanoff / Illuminati buy the dip.

**how is possible watch exactly the same graph pattern, actors that looks like exactly as Ellen Mask and the new china politics, plus the** ***meme*** (**coin) that rise and breaks down**. He says the closes prices 50K that was totally suitable for BTC some weeks ago.

[similar patterns induced by Bogdanoff Twins, today BTC\/USD traderview-binance](https://preview.redd.it/feyuhapu64171.png?width=867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c7dcdeb40c11d23fe32e96e987573c73c00b6e0)

This is just part of what I found: ***the wiki and Bizonacci are not conected***, but have the same deep level of lore:

&gt;*The Bogdanoff twins hold dominion over the Stock Realm. Boris sets out to the Stock Realm in pursuit of Sminem, who* ***offers to show him the secrets of his past when Boris lost the memories*** *of his nuclear origins in the late 1990s.* ***The final battle between Boris and the Bogdanoff twins is widely regarded as one of the all-time high***  *points of the manga and of the franchise in general, being the first time we catch a glimpse of* ***Boris' legendary*** ***RDS-46 Maximum Output*** ***form.***

&amp;#x200B;

Who is Boris? well, that is unknow to me, but I represent him as the ''savior'' in this saga, but IRL is *The Hive* (or reddit coop mind from any sub). Why? *Because Boris' legendary* *RDS-46 Maximum Output* *form sound as* ***Reddit right now crashing all, like the most powerfull form of a socialmedia: the hive mindset.***

I've only been doing this for a few years, so I'm still learning these lessons, which are a part of the experience for many people.

CryptoCurrency,Can BSC collapse?,"My thought started from the intention to move some assets out of Binance (you know, keep in the exchange just the amount you want to use for trading, etc, etc, ...)  


At the moment of withdrawal, of course my first choice was the BSC, due to the low fees compared to the ETH blockchain.  


But then i thought ""What if the whole Binance ecosystem collapse?""   


Of course this would be a black swan, even a bigger one than the MtGox one, and the chances of this to happen are approximately zero, but..... what if?  


And so my mind went to the fact that BSC has only 21 validator nodes, of which the most are in a way or another ""controlled"" by Binance itself.

--""It (Bitcoin) is basically Monopoly money that can't be counterfeited. Or think, a video game token (bitcoin) awarded for overcoming game obstacles (solving a math problem) recorded in a cheatproof score ledger (blockchain). And somehow, people have ""assigned value"" to these tokens OUTSIDE of the game!""

--""Bitcoin is certainly in a class of its own. The “complete gamble” asset class. The class to completely avoid. Who with wealth would risk large portions on such a risky gamble. Noone with wealth would risk large sums on this nonsensical gamble. If they took such risks they would not be wealthy in the first place. 

start a business. Work hard. Plan harder. And be persistent with patience. This is how wealth is generated.""

--""It (Bitcoin) is basically Monopoly money that can't be counterfeited. Or think, a video game token (bitcoin) awarded for overcoming game obstacles (solving a math problem) recorded in a cheatproof score ledger (blockchain). And somehow, people have ""assigned value"" to these tokens OUTSIDE of the game!""

--""Bitcoin is certainly in a class of its own. The “complete gamble” asset class. The class to completely avoid. Who with wealth would risk large portions on such a risky gamble. Noone with wealth would risk large sums on this nonsensical gamble. If they took such risks they would not be wealthy in the first place. 

start a business. Work hard. Plan harder. And be persistent with patience. This is how wealth is generated.""

CryptoCurrency,Here's how crypto cycles work ... and why crashes aren't scary.,"In 2018 I put all my savings into ADA at around 70c.  I hoped to double my money.

It then crashed and went as low as 2c.  I hodled all the way down.

For 2 years it was down in the small numbers.  I hodled.

And then in January this year, in just a matter of weeks, it flew right back up from 10c to the 70c I bought in at.

And within just a few months of that, it was up at $2.70.

So that's, 4x gains in just 3 years.

If you'd bought in at 2c when no-one else was thinking about crypto, you'd have made 135x.

And that's how I see crypto, it doesn't matter when you buy in on a good coin, you just wait for the wheel to spin back round.

And to put a measly 4x into real life context, it's like buying a house in 2018 and in 2021 you have 4.

That's a big wealth increase.

If you'd bought in and sat for a few years at 2c, you'd have gone from owning 1 house, to owning several streets.

That's a very big wealth increase.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you lose all your money in a crash, don't worry, just sit back and wait till 2025, it'll be yours again but more so.

CryptoCurrency,"Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin Is Now Considered an Investable Asset, Clients Are Treating BTC as New Asset Class","**""Global investment bank Goldman Sachs now considers bitcoin an investable asset. “Clients and beyond are largely treating it as a new asset class, which is notable — it’s not often that we get to witness the emergence of a new asset class,” said Goldman Sachs’ analyst.**

## Goldman Sachs Now Considers Bitcoin an Investable Asset

Goldman Sachs published a research note on cryptocurrency this week stating that bitcoin has become an investable asset, a reverse of its earlier stance. Mathew McDermott, the bank’s global head of digital assets, [wrote](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-is-officially-a-new-asset-class-goldman-sachs-103540636.html):

&gt;***Bitcoin is now considered an investable asset. It has its own idiosyncratic risk, partly because it’s still relatively new and going through an adoption phase.***

“And it doesn’t behave as one would intuitively expect relative to other assets given the analogy to digital gold; to date, it’s tended to be more aligned with risk-on assets,” he continued, elaborating:

&gt;***Clients and beyond are largely treating it as a new asset class, which is notable — it’s not often that we get to witness the emergence of a new asset class.***

In February, when Coinbase [filed](https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-ipo-reference-price-250-nasdaq-listing-watershed-crypto/) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a direct listing on Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs said that bitcoin was not yet an investable asset class.

The firm also initiated its coverage of the Coinbase stock (NASDAQ: COIN) on Monday with a buy rating and a price target of $306. Coinbase is currently trading at $227.88.

The Goldman Sachs analyst also acknowledges in the research note that regulation of the crypto space poses a significant risk to further price appreciation. Nonetheless, McDermott said institutional clients remain keen on adding crypto exposure to their portfolios.

He further noted that now “discussions with institutional clients revolve around how they can learn more on the topic and get access to the space.” In contrast, a few years ago, institutions were asking about what bitcoin or cryptocurrencies were.

Goldman Sachs has been bullish about bitcoin lately. The bank [formally established](https://news.bitcoin.com/goldman-sachs-cryptocurrency-trading-team/) a cryptocurrency trading team earlier this month and [said](https://news.bitcoin.com/goldman-sachs-bitcoin-derivatives-trading-institutional-demand-grow-significantly/) that institutional demand for crypto “continues to grow significantly.”""

CryptoCurrency,"New to crypto, can someone help me understand taxes? (U.S.)","Hello everyone, I have been researching crypto throughout the past year, and finally decided to invest due to the crash over the past few days. I am a college student in the U.S., so I don't have a substantial amount of capital to start. I have been trying to understand how crypto will work for me next year when I file my tax return, and I am pretty confused.

From my understanding, crypto is categorized as property by the federal government so you have to pay property tax on it. You only have to pay if you sell, trade, or earn crypto as an income; if you just buy with USD, you're fine. I have only bought coins with USD, and have not yet traded or sold as I want to make sure I fully understand the tax implications. I don't wanna end up getting a massive bill come tax season that I can't afford.

My goal with crypto at the moment is to make money in the short term, almost like day trading with stocks. However, I don't understand if this is viable due to tax. Say I bought 3 coins for $30 total, then 2 days later sold them all for $60 total. I would only be taxed on the gain of $30 if I'm understanding it correctly. As I said, I don't have substantial capital, so at the moment I would be doing relatively small trades like that. I would love to be able to make some money on the side before school starts back up in the fall to help with expenses. Can someone help me understand how to figure out what I would owe in taxes, and if it would even be worth doing small day trades like this? I'm honestly lost. Thanks ahead of time for any help!",1621889154,"New to crypto, can someone help me understand taxes?

CryptoCurrency,My experience after 1 month of crypto,"I started crypto on 28 April 2021, and I wanted to compile some things that I have learned/ experienced/ expectations.  Please take this with a grain of salt as this is what I have gotten from crypto with my limited time spent.  Obviously there are people within this subreddit that are far more knowledgeable than I am and they might be better to learn from.  

Starting new is kinda hard as there's just a huge learning curve that looks a tad too demanding to start with, but its actually not too bad as long as you are comfortable with taking your time to learn and taking this seriously.  But just wanted to share how I started.

I started with Coinbase, which is a crypto exchange platform, that a friend introduced me to and the layout is rather simply but gets the job done.  Though its a little bare in features, but I think its more beginner friendly.  Coinbase has a reward tab where you can earn some crypto by reading/ watching a short video and answer questions.  From this, I received $39 of various cryptocurrencies.  Currently as of 24 May 2021, the value of rewards is $25.  I used this as a base to learn crypto as I go with the feeling that I have not spent any of my money so I can be more courageous with my actions in pursuit to learn.

Within a week and a half I went from $39 to $121. The next day I was at $44.  NGL that scared me how in a day I potentially lost $77.  But that's crypto for you, and I just that as a learning experience.  Once a coin is at ATH, don't hold thinking it'll keep going up, or do, its up to you to decide.  Soon followed that was the whole debacle with Elon Musk, China, etc. So it slowly crept lower.  From this you learn that crypto is influenced by media, and sometimes you gotta expect stupidity. 

Now that a month nearly have passed, I'm glad I was able to get into crypto with the safenet that I have not invested any actual money.  

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some basic lesson that I have learned and hope you can take something away from it

&amp;#x200B;

* Crypto is volatile, meaing that it can change drastically.  Media can swing things as well.  But that part of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't get discouraged if you make a mistake, rather, learn what you did wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

* It is **NOT** a get rich quick scheme.  If anyone tells you it is, just ignore them cause you are smarter than that.

&amp;#x200B;

* Learn graph trends and capitalize on it.  Predict the trends before hand rather than guessing and hoping it works out.  Be proactive with your decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

* Only put in money you are okay with losing.  **DO NOT** put in huge chunks of money thinking you can turn that for a quick gain.  Instead save up some money here and there.  Save up all the change you have for the end of the month and put that into crypto.  Or instead of buying that Starbucks coffee, use that $5 towards crypto.  Be smart with your money.

&amp;#x200B;

* Crypto is for the long term.  Back projects that you believe in and keep with it.  Some of these shitcoins may get boost here and there, but stay true with what you believe in for the future.  Give it a year or more, gains happen over time.

&amp;#x200B;

* Life your live.  Don't constantly look at your crypto.  There's so much to do out there, so go do it. If you are honest with yourself and put in time to learn and back projects, you can feel more easy with your decisions.

CryptoCurrency,This is what a Serial Scammer Looks Like,"Just to raise awareness for those new to crypto there are many risks outside of just volatility especially once you start doing off-exchange trading.

Bitcoin 2021 Is Moving To Miami!
Bitcoin 2021 will move the biggest Bitcoin event in history to Miami, targeting dates of June 4–5, with Jack Dorsey, Nick Szabo, Michael Saylor, Cynthia Lummis and Tony Hawk as headline speakers!
Our decision to move Bitcoin 2021 from Los Angeles to Miami was not an easy one, but given the circumstances regarding availability in the State of California, we feel the move is necessary this year. The show must go on!

In addition to moving cities, we are also pushing the conference back slightly to June 4–5, so as to allow ample time for the second wave of COVID-19 to pass and for vaccine rollout to take place. We are more excited than ever about this event, and we’ve got tons of big announcements in store. Rest assured that we’ve been working our tails off behind the scenes to make this conference the most unforgettable experience in Bitcoin history.

Bitcoin 2021 will feature a massive collection of the best and brightest minds in the space, dozens of one-of-a-kind BTC activations and the chance to celebrate the world’s best technology with all of your internet friends IRL. Learn more about our full lineup of speakers, event partners, unique offerings and more across this site.

CryptoCurrency,Mine Monero With MoneroOcean,"Hello,

Monero mining can be only profitable achieved by mining with your CPU, the Ryzen CPU's do a reasonable amount of hashrate and are the best for mining.

How can you improve your mining profits with XMR?

You can check out MoneroOcean pool, it lets you mine Monero only or instaling their version of XMRRig will let you mine the easiest algo. You will be mining different algo's but you will be always paid in XMR with the conversion being automatically made by the pool. Your profits will increase since XMR is not a easy algo to mine and by letting the auto switch feature do the work for you, you will see better results.

The pool gives you an estimation 24 hour earnings rate you can check it and it will be higher than the normal mining of XMR. By mining in this pool you will ensure decentralization since it's not the pool woth more mining hashrate.

Let me give you a good example how this works out for you, imagine the pool founds a ETH block, everyone will share the profit and be paid in XMR, this can make your earnings spike if the ETH block is really big and your earnings will surpass your average daily rate, this has happened to me. So your calculated earnings by the pool is nothing more than a estimative since if the pool is lucky you will earn a lot more.

Like every pool the higher your hashrate is the better earnings you will have.

Check how you can setup XMRig to serve you better or just go with the standard XMRig from the pool with algo-switching and you will be good to go and have better earnings.

Hope this helps you and good earnings.

CryptoCurrency,"be careful using gift cards to buy bitcoin, you may be scammed","My BF tried to use gift card to buy bitcoin in order to avoid KYC, but end up getting scammed, be careful.

He forgot which site he used, but the site wanted KYC info to use a gift card, (he did not provide any info) charged him $200, and did not give him any bitcoin.

Today, I finally got around to the gift card site to see the transaction, it went through.  Note: you have to register your gift card to see your transaction.  The transaction shows a 1800 number.  So I called them to see what can be done.  The person answering said it's a restaurant equipment sales/ customer service line.

If you must try getting crypto using a gift card:

\*start with a very small amount

\*have good record of which site you tried and the outcome, take screenshots/ printed pages if possible.  This way if you need to dispute it down the road you have a record.  

\*review your visa gift card transaction carefully to check for discrepancies

He lost $200 which was not a lot of money to us at this phase of our lives but we are frugal, we try to squeeze more cash into investments, $200 can buy us 2 months of groceries.

Last week was a successful week for XPOSE PROTOCOL, where we made a lot of progress towards our goal. Our goal is to build an extraordinary blockchain drive marketing brand. We also revealed the first two member of the board of advice: Ralph de Geus and Vasco Rouw.

Our goal is to build an extreme marketing brand where we organize epic events to inspire, connect, and help people. Together with the community we can choose to break world records, build schools in developing countries or organizing dance festivals for XPOSE holders. 

This is a long-term project and NOT a pump and dump. Today we sold a part of our marketing wallet to transfer XPOSE tokens and BNB to the liquidity pool. The marketing wallet will be 100% used for the good of this amazing community. With selling a part of the marketing wallet and storing it in the liquidity pool we aim to make the XPOSE token more stable. If we do not do this, we will skyrocket to the moon and there will only be a couple winners and there will be a lot of people that lose money. Like we said, we are here for the long term. We want to impact millions of people around the globe. We want to do this together.

We will soon start impacting lives of people around the globe, and this will make them want to be part of this amazing community. Of course, this will let the token grow, as we already have seen massive growth. To be clear, we are a lifestyle and community token. You do not want to go all in, you just want to be part of this movement by investing a small % of your net worth. A movement that will create beautiful experiences and moments in life. A movement that will help people in need. A movement that inspires people.

We want to thank you for your trust, this is just the beginning.  This week we have even more exciting announcements and we will release two more experts that will join our advisory board.

Tomorrow we will reveal a HUGE co-operation between XPOSE and a worldwide brand.

CryptoCurrency,Ethereum 2.0 First Upgrade Altair Is Coming: Key Notes for Validators,"“The Altair upgrade will seek to return the original strictness into the new Ethereum protocol.

One of the most interesting things about the Ethereum blockchain is the ongoing plans to migrate from the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) network to a more scalable Proof of Stake (PoS) model. The proposed plan has been in the works for a long since it dawns on the Ethereum developers that the current model cannot sustain the growth of smart contracts and DApps built on the network in the long term.

The move became more obvious when the Beacon Chain went live back in December 2020, and the network has been running smoothly since then. Ethereum 2.0 is thus on track to get its first major upgrade tagged Altair, after the brightest star in the northern constellation of Aquila. The upgrade is billed to take place around July or August and will be following a similar timeline to the PoW Ethereum network’s 11th upgrade or the London Hard Fork.

According to Coindesk, the Ethereum developers are working to let both upgrades take place at the same period, the reason? To let validators upgrade their software for both networks simultaneously. Many know about the London hard fork and its potentials to overhaul the current fee structure, however, a little is known about the Altair upgrade. Here is a keynote for validators per the scheduled upgrade.

Ethereum 2.0 Altair Upgrade: Here Is How Validators Will be Affected

When the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain was launched last year, some of the standards validators are expected to adhere to for interacting with the network were lowered to encourage participation. The Altair upgrade will seek to return the original strictness into the new Ethereum protocol.

Per the Coindesk report, as of May 18, 2021, there are as many as 141,327 active validators and 3,816 pending validators. As it currently stands, inactive validators see the value of their staked ETH slashed by 11.8%. After the Altair upgrade, this fine will be increased to 15.4% to encourage more participation.

The penalty or fines for network-threatening activities such as double signing will increase to 0.5 ETH, up from the 0.25 ETH being levied before. This higher value will seek to closely model the punishment originally designated for the Ethereum 2.0 protocol.

While the upgrade is bound to usher in strictness as defined, validators are going to benefit more from the proposed incentive boost that will be introduced. The block reward incentive will grow from 3% to 12.5% as the upgrade will also lead to a higher staking reward for the protocol as planned by the end of 2021. The final merging of both versions of Ethereum is also expected to be heralded by the Altair upgrade.

Additionally, Ethereum 2.0 will eventually introduce a new piece of software called Light Clients. These clients are designed to operate with a significantly lower requirement compared to what an average validator uses. The Light Clients will be made into a mobile application that can allow individuals to be more engaged with the network by verifying transactions right on their own phones. This will be a new frontier for the Ethereum blockchain.

Ethereum’s Energy Consumption Trimming

The broader cryptocurrency ecosystem is tilting towards demanding more energy-efficient blockchain networks. While Ethereum 2.0 is billed to use a significantly lower amount of energy compared to the Proof-of-Work network by 99%, pursuing energy efficiency will be a way for the Ethereum blockchain to solidify its grip as the world’s most used blockchain in the near future.”

What is everyone’s thoughts? Especially those holding ETH (which I’m sure is most of you)

Per the Coindesk report, as of May 18, 2021, there are as many as 141,327 active validators and 3,816 pending validators. As it currently stands, inactive validators see the value of their staked ETH slashed by 11.8%. After the Altair upgrade, this fine will be increased to 15.4% to encourage more participation.

The penalty or fines for network-threatening activities such as double signing will increase to 0.5 ETH, up from the 0.25 ETH being levied before. This higher value will seek to closely model the punishment originally designated for the Ethereum 2.0 protocol.

While the upgrade is bound to usher in strictness as defined, validators are going to benefit more from the proposed incentive boost that will be introduced. The block reward incentive will grow from 3% to 12.5% as the upgrade will also lead to a higher staking reward for the protocol as planned by the end of 2021. The final merging of both versions of Ethereum is also expected to be heralded by the Altair upgrade.

Additionally, Ethereum 2.0 will eventually introduce a new piece of software called Light Clients. These clients are designed to operate with a significantly lower requirement compared to what an average validator uses. The Light Clients will be made into a mobile application that can allow individuals to be more engaged with the network by verifying transactions right on their own phones. This will be a new frontier for the Ethereum blockchain.

Ethereum’s Energy Consumption Trimming

The broader cryptocurrency ecosystem is tilting towards demanding more energy-efficient blockchain networks. While Ethereum 2.0 is billed to use a significantly lower amount of energy compared to the Proof-of-Work network by 99%, pursuing energy efficiency will be a way for the Ethereum blockchain to solidify its grip as the world’s most used blockchain in the near future.”

What is everyone’s thoughts? Especially those holding ETH (which I’m sure is most of you)

CryptoCurrency,What exchange platforms do about aggregating of user deposit addresses? (ETH/ERC20...),"Hi,

I'm trying to create an exchange platform..

\- We know that every exchange platforms have their own central-wallets (hot/cold) for every blockchains..

\- In BTC, DASH, LTC, BCH when we create a wallet address, we are having access to all of its derivation paths and there is no need to transfer user's balance to the central-wallet of the exchange. so users easily deposit their coins and the exchange can easily spend all of them in one-single place by default.

\- In BNB, XLM, XRP we have memo/info value so we have only one central-wallet and no need to create deposit-address for every users ... and we have no problem here too.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

1) In Dogecoin, Tron, TRC20 as far as i know, because of the low/zero network fee we can transfer user's deposit to our central-wallet by a script. is it a normal way to do it?

2) In ETH/ERC20 the problem is a lot bigger:

2.1) In exchange platforms, a user have his own Ethereum/ERC20 deposit address.

2.2) He is going to deposit 5.00 USDTERC20 to his exchange-deposit-address.

2.3) In the exchange he converts it to Fiat and then requests for a withdrawal by bank for example...

2.4) The exchange would withdraw his fiat amount after deduct it's commission etc..

2.5) What would happen about the user's deposit address? because of the network-fee, is it a Financial loss for the exchange or they have a specific way to transfer that 5 USDTERC20 somehow? this is just a sample ... you can imagine another user transfer 0.001 eth (2.5 USD)..

&amp;#x200B;

I've been noticing that this sub is pretty harsh in regards to safemoon and I was wondering why?

I know it all started as a meme for some, but safemoon has actual good projects to back themself. They are developing a wallet with tokenomics for every crypto, ledger brought out fud against them, so they decided to make their own cold wallet.

I could've easily taken my profits, but I see a future in safemoon and I'm just wondering why some of you guys don't. Regardless everything, I'm not expecting to be a millionaire tomorrow, heck it's not even about the money anymore, it's about the project, I wanna see where safemoon gets, with it's potential.

I'm asking to just leave your honest opinion to why you don't see safemoon in the same way as me.

P.S.: I don't really know which flair to use, but I guess finance is fine :P and sorry if I made any spelling mistakes, I'm only 15 and dutch is my native language.",1280,72,1208
CryptoCurrency,Why can't people just stick to their original plan to hold long term?,"I feel this is not how investing long term works. 

I believe the whole idea of holding long term is to...

- find something you believe in

- dump in what you can afford to lose

-  hold for X amount of years you planned or until whatever X gain is your goal.

**It's very important to know yourself before you invest**.  

Before you invest long term you have to ask yourself...

""*Will I lose confidence and sell low the first time it dips*?""

###If the answer is yes...

maybe it's not the wisest move to invest long term in the first place because the reality of investing is dips. Nothing will ever perpetually go up forever without a dip, flash crash, or a big crash.

That's not how it works.  

###If the answer is No...

Then long term holding us for you.

If you can are aware , and prepared mentally that dips will happen, and you will go into the negatives at some point in time, or possibly lose all your money, then you are mentally prepared to invest long term. 

This is how investing works. It starts by mentally preparing yourself to lose or go through a long period of time, maybe even 2 years straight before you see a recovery.

###buying in when the market is fully hyped up.

Doing your research into the history of the crypto market or stock before you invest gives you a better idea what you might expect than any expert will tell you.    

If you see that thought out it's history Everytime there was super hype around crypto , and big dip occured afterwards, then you have to understand that might happen again and maybe might not be the best time to buy in. 

###having FOMO. 

It's simple to get that fear that if you don't buy now while everyone else is buying then you will miss out and that whatever crypto you are looking at might keep going up and up and up to a point where it's now too expensive to buy. 

This goes back to what I said in the beginning.   

*Nothing ever does that without a dip, flash crash or  bear market before it reaches a new ATH*    it's the law of averages.  Eventually something has to give where the price of something drops.   This can be compared to anything. A team that keeps winning every game...there will be a time where they have a losing streak. So if you keep betting on a team to win because it seems they never lose...you're gonna end up disappointed one day.  Maybe you'll get too cocky because they are playing a shitty team that day and you can't imagine them ever losing so you dump a large sum of money down and then BAM. You lose.  It's all over the news ""Shocking upset! Best team loses to shit team""

CryptoCurrency,"New to crypto, can someone help me understand taxes? (U.S.)","Hello everyone, I have been researching crypto throughout the past year, and finally decided to invest due to the crash over the past few days. I am a college student, so I don't have a substantial amount of capital to start. I have been trying to understand how crypto will work for me next year when I file my tax return, and I am pretty confused. 

From my understanding, crypto is categorized as property by the federal government so you have to  pay property tax on it. You only have to pay if you sell, trade, or earn crypto as an income; if you just buy with USD, you're fine. I have only bought coins with USD, and have not yet traded or sold as I want to make sure I fully understand the tax implications. I don't wanna end up getting a massive bill come tax season that I can't afford.

My goal with crypto at the moment is to make money in the short term, almost like day trading with stocks. However, I don't understand if this is viable due to tax. Say I bought 3 coins for $30 total, then 2 days later sold them all for $60 total. I would only be taxed on the gain of $30 if I'm understanding it correctly. As I said, I don't have substantial capital, so at the moment I would be doing relatively small trades like that. I would love to be able to make some money on the side before school starts back up in the fall to help with expenses. Can someone help me understand how to figure out what I would owe in taxes, and if it would even be worth doing small day trades like this?  I'm honestly lost. Thanks ahead of time for any help!",1621885235,"New to crypto, can someone help me understand taxes?

CryptoCurrency,A stock investor pal told me BTC will reach $6000 because of the 200 day MA. Here’s why I think he’s wrong:,"A buddy of mine who has been investing for a little while now tried to drop a statement like that in a group chat. I’m pretty invested in crypto as well as other things but I’m really intrigued with crypto markets and their future. He dropped this sort of thing early this morning and I just couldn’t wrap my head around it. So I crunched some quick numbers. 

If BTC hit $6000 a coin, it’s market cap would be sitting just $115B down from its current cap of $716B. That’s a bleed out from just BTC of over half a billion. With BTCs current dominance over the market at roughly 44% would mean that the entire crypto market would be worth a bit over $250B down from its current market cap of 1.6T. Even if BTC dominance dropped to below 25% that would still drop the current market cap or crypto by almost a trillion dollars. It already bled out a trillion during that dip....

CryptoCurrency,WowDoge wallet help,"Hi, I’m hoping someone can offer some advice as I’m stuck.  Approximately 6 yrs ago, I had my Dogecoins in a Dogecoin QT wallet but needed to free up some space on my Mac so switched over to a WowDoge app as it was a lite wallet and promptly forgot about them.  Obviously with recent events, I’ve dug up my old wallet file and found that WowDoge app ceased being supported but is still downloadable.  The app is pretty buggy on my Mac and essentially hangs whenever I try to do something.  I switched over to a Windows machine and the app seems stable but I’ve been stuck on “Synchonizing...” @ 3% for more than a week, so I suspect this is also a dead end.   

My question to anyone with more clue than I have is whether there is another path I can explore here?  Would any of the current wallet apps possibly load the WowDoge wallet (its a different file type *.dogewallet rather than a standard wallet.dat naming).  Or are there other things I could try?

FWIW, I can see my transactions out of the Dogecoin QT wallet so I know some info but not sure if that is helpful to me.

CryptoCurrency,What is your understanding of Cryptocurrency?,"Hi, the intention behind this post is to gather some information about how much people understand about cryptocurrency?  


First about Dogecoin as I wrote about it, then about Cryptocurrency in general.

## Will [Dogecoin](https://lewis-anderson.com/topics/cryptocurrency/dogecoin/) reach $1? – Is it worth investing in?

On Tuesday, the 4th of May [Dogecoin](https://lewis-anderson.com/topics/cryptocurrency/dogecoin/) reached an all-time high and was trading for $0.53 halfway to $1. As there are countless different variations to account for when it comes to digital currency it’s extremely difficult to predict if [dogecoin](https://lewis-anderson.com/topics/cryptocurrency/dogecoin/) ever will reach $1 or not.  


On the 06 of May 2021 [Dogecoin](https://lewis-anderson.com/topics/cryptocurrency/dogecoin/) reached $0.66 so it’s getting higher and higher even though it does drop back down again. It's at $0.33 at the time of posting this.

I have created poll on my website which I want the data graph to display an accurate reflection of what people who have heard of cryptocurrency and their understanding of it is and where better to go than reddit.  


Please bear with me as this is my first reddit post, I heard this is a good place to collect poll information?

So, if 1 - 2 is **Hardly know anything about cryptocurrency** and 9 - 10 being, **you create your own coins!**

Where do you sit on this scale? Please answer the poll on my website which can be found here: [Dogecoin | Will Dogecoin reach 1$? | Why is Dogecoin a joke? (lewis-anderson.com)](https://lewis-anderson.com/dogecoin-can-i-make-money-with-it/)

Oh, I also included some details about Dogecoin. Let me know what you think and leave a comment on my website :-)

The fact that we are intelligent creatures (well that in my mind is also pretty debatable) makes us believe that we know things for sure and therefore can influence and control things and out comes. At very least we can figure them out and make them behave in ways we want. That is just an illusion. Our so called intelligents is not intelligents at all but ability to rationalize things but not control it or truly understand it because most things in nature are just simply to complex for our little minds to grasp. Still that wont stop us from trying and pretending we got it. In most cases our track record of success in that arena is very short period of control or direct effect upon nature or systems we created that always ends in some kind of violent rejection or correction to the natural order of things.

That brings me to price market predictions. All of them are nothing but hopes and dreams. Someone likes to see a coins at certain level so they create a scenario where that is possible using previous performance, indicators, charts, data, analysis that might convince others that it all makes sense but it really means nothing at all. Its just an elaborate attempt to convince others that you can predict the future which is really absurd if you give it any amount of serious thought.

All you doing is trying to justify the future you want to see, but no one knows how things will pen out in the future. Previous performance happens because of many different incontrollable and complex factors that all happen at certain timing and certain order. You cant just assume it will duplicate and reply the same in the future.

I will give you an example. Last bull market BTC went up aggressively till Altcoins season started and then it kept going up at more reasonable pace while Alts where just going bananas and out pacing BTC by many factors. That created historical charts of BTC/coin that people look at today and say, look we are nowhere close to this or that coin price compare to BTC so it should go much higher. Well hold on a second. What if BTC stops going up and actually start declining like we saw in the end of Apr and beginning of May this year while other coins where going up a lot. That will give you the identical chart results but not a lot of Altcoins price appreciation and lower BTC prices. Its all about timing and market sentiment at the end.

You want another example of timing. If ADA released smart contracts 2 months ago the price would probably be double if not more but still the same bull market, and investors sentiment and BTC price appreciation, but no one can really predict those events and their exact timing. Who knows maybe if ETH has triggered its 2.0 in Jan we could be looking at the new leader on the market cap board right now.

What I'm trying to say is that NO one knows what the price will be for any coin in any time frame. They hope what the price could be and they find indicators that could justify that outcome. That is all. I look at it like this. This sector has bright future and a lot of growth so prices of coins should go up in a long run and by a many factors due to its infancy status. Timing of that movement no one knows. In the mean time they will also go up and down depending on the bull/bear cycles. The most price appreciation will happen if both mass bull cycles and success stories of adoption and growth for individual coins happen at the same time. Trying to time it is not possible so pick a price you would be very happy with like, buy, stake and accumulate in the mean time, and if the price you picked is reasonable according to some previous indicators then you have pretty good chance it will get there. Period. Everything else is noise and speculation and wishful thinking that will not matter because the market does what it wants, any attempt of manipulation is temporary and we are just along for the ride.",1621880830,"The Illusion of control

CryptoCurrency,Sustainability-as-a-Service: Bitcoin's Saving Grace,"Bitcoin is marred by the same issue that faces any other company, institution, asset class, community, individual, etc:

**Sustainability.**

As is, proof-of-work mining will kill Bitcoin, along with any other crypto still using POW. One method to fix this is to make the switch to proof-of-stake, like Bitcoin's little brother Ethereum is doing. However, this is not a practical solution for Bitcoin, as its blockchain is not suitable for a switch to POS without any major structural changes which carry their own challenges and risks.

Bitcoin needs to embrace mining as a source of sustainability. The only way for bitcoin to survive is prove that its impact on the world is positive. It's done this already by introducing a decentralized vision of the future, but now it needs to prove itself once more.

**Mining: A Subsidy for the Future**

The future of bitcoin relies on its use of renewable energy to power its POW-reliant blockchain. However, the reverse can also be made true. Renewable energy production has not yet seen the level of government subsidies needed to achieve the ambitious goals set out in the Paris Climate Agreement. Bitcoin mining can provide the clientele needed to support a renewable energy initiative. Especially in regions of the world where the cost of renewable energy is not yet competitive with gas, coal, or other fossil fuels. Bitcoin mining operations can be built in remote communities that need renewable energy sources but can not sustain a project at scale alone without financial support from miners. In an ideal world, Bitcoin mining leads to renewable energy production, which can then support energy infrastructure to power local communities, industrial zones, and more.

**Bitcoin's Saving Grace**

Sustainability, renewable energy, and our environment have two paths to take with Bitcoin. Use it to subsidize our transition to a cleaner, healthier world **or** eliminate it, rely on government support to make the transition while cryptocurrencies pivot towards a POS solution.

CryptoCurrency,"Staking, a gonzo guide","Be warned: this is the idiot’s guide to all things blockchain, and if you are at all familiar with crypto, this will be of zero use to you. But, if you are as slack as me and still getting your toes wet, then you may find something of benefit in here. Let’s go.

Very simply, ‘staking’ is the process of submitting your tokens to be locked into a cryptocurrency wallet for a period of time in order the earn rewards.  So what kind of rewards for the coin holder are we talking here? Well, perhaps when you were wee, your ma or da opened an account with the building society for you and put a hundred quid in it. And do you remember being taken down there every couple of months with your bank book, and the lady behind the desk taking it off you and printing your interest in it? I do. She handed it back and you had a look inside, and wa-hey!… a free five quid out of nowhere had just appeared in your account. Ah, the days. Long gone the bank book. Also, who’s making interest on their savings now!? Forget it.   

Staking is a bit like that. You lodge your crypto in an account and don’t touch it for a while, and when you come back, you got some free money waiting for you. They even call it ‘APR’, an acronym which you may remember from those glory days in the building society, one which now does little more than recall that warm feeling of nostalgia.

So, let’s get technical. Where can you stake? Many, if not most, wallets offer staking as standard. So that I don’t err in my advice, I’ll stick to those I’m familiar with. I’m currently staking in three places. Firstly, I got a handful of ATOM staked through my Kraken account. Kraken is an exchange. What most cryptoheads will warn you about exchanges is that, while they are a good place to buy and sell coins, the cryptographic keys that protect the security of the coins in your account are theirs and not yours, so ultimately, it is still technically their money. Until your coins are offsite and in a private wallet, your money is not entirely safe. Remember Mt. Gox? The Japanese crypto exchange that collapsed (or was rug-pulled?) and billions disappeared? Theoretically, it can happen to any exchange. I’ve been with Kraken since 2016 and never had a problem, but I’ve recently started spreading my coins across various private wallets, the keys of which are held by me and me alone. So, back to the ATOM. I’ve a few coins staked in there at a return of 7 per cent APR, which is pretty slow, but it still brings in a little coin with zero effort on my part. I’m also staking my ADA holdings in a Daedalus wallet. Daedalus is built on the Cardano ecosystem, and the wallet downloads the entire Cardano blockchain and verifies every transaction that takes place on it, which means that, security wise, it’s second to none. Daedalus is available only for PC and not for Android. Finally, I’m staking what Harmony ONE I own in a Blits wallet. Harmony is an ecosystem built on the Ethereum blockchain, and is a system which is showing great promise. (I wrote a few articles a week or two ago detailing how Harmony can be used to mint and sell NFTs for artists.)

Those are three platforms on which I’m currently staking. What does it involve? It goes like this: you nominate a staking pool, which is basically a wallet held by a group of people who are pooling their resources in order to be able to validate the blockchain. Your crypto will go into this shared wallet for the length of time that you nominate, and when the returns come back in the form of shared ‘interest’ (APR), you get a slice of the pie (wa-hey!).

It’s that simple. Staking is done from a minimum of a week to ten days up to a year, or even five. Naturally, the longer the better.

So there you are. If you’ve read this article, well done. You have been inducted into the ways of gonzo crypto.

CryptoCurrency,Is crypto 'currency' an accurate term?,"Coins seen to be often viewed as an analog for commodities, stocks, or annuities, but not necessarily currency. The number of dollars that a token is worth seems very important. As is the movement against the stock market as a selection of where to place dollars. Or the apy for staking. There are innumerable calls to action to hold. Comparisons to gold are everywhere. People seem to want coins for projects they believe in, and exchanging dollars for them increases market price. Coins seen more a way to build capital without a company (project) issuing common stock. Or as a hedge against inflation. Or as a way to earn dollars. The very idea to dca in and never exchange out seems, in a way, antithetical to the purpose of currency.

I don't see much of any major push to make direct purchases with crypto, just to buy crypto with dollars and then take profits in dollars at some point. There also doesn't seem to be much of a push to exchange labor for crypto directly. So the idea of a currency, a store of value, doesn't seem to actually be there at the moment. It seems more a way to accumulate wealth, the same way we exchange our efforts for dollars, and then exchange those dollars for what we ultimately want to hold long term. In other words, dollars remain the currency. With so many projects it doesn't seem likely that we'd settle on one of this current crop as an exchange of our time and effort, at least in lieu of dollars. Either because they are worth too much in the long run to give up to someone else, or not worth enough to receive.

Is this good or bad for cryptocurrency acceptance? And does this impact acceptance of blockchain technology as a whole, or just these individual projects using the technology in different ways? Or another question, would a digital federal US dollar on blockchain be more likely than one of these current projects to become the new version of currency?",1621879698,"Is crypto 'currency' an accurate term?Coins seen to be often viewed as an analog for commodities, stocks, or annuities, but not necessarily currency.

There also doesn't seem to be much of a push to exchange labor for crypto directly. So the idea of a currency, a store of value, doesn't seem to actually be there at the moment. It seems more a way to accumulate wealth, the same way we exchange our efforts for dollars, and then exchange those dollars for what we ultimately want to hold long term. In other words, dollars remain the currency. With so many projects it doesn't seem likely that we'd settle on one of this current crop as an exchange of our time and effort, at least in lieu of dollars. Either because they are worth too much in the long run to give up to someone else, or not worth enough to receive.

Is this good or bad for cryptocurrency acceptance? And does this impact acceptance of blockchain technology as a whole, or just these individual projects using the technology in different ways? Or another question, would a digital federal US dollar on blockchain be more likely than one of these current projects to become the new version of currency?",1950,38,1912

Crypto.com offer looks more appealing (due to spotify) but the problem is that they want 350€, in other words, I'll need to pay attention to CRO value to make sure it always stays above 350€

Binance on the other hand just needs me to have 1 BNB. The price will fluctuate just like CRO obviously but at least I don't need to worry about balancing it out.

Binance also seems to be bigger and more widely used than crypto.com, so it feels more secure in case crypto market crashes just like in 2018. Please correct me if I'm wrong about this though!

The generated interest of one successful safe token has led to many others trying to outdo each other in this bubble of *hypenomics*, which will eventually burst.

*Hypenomics – A token which has no use case or utility but only growing its price through hype.*

The general misconception of many is 'wen lambo' 'wen moon' and so forth. The mindset of many who invest in *hypenomics*; is the get rich quick psychology, forced into your minds of what crypto currency is truly all about.

The very reason of *hypenomics* was the opportunity to divide and separate from this endless endeavour has been the very fundamentals of our developers. The labelling of our token, to be put into the same basket as the rest of the eggs before launch, was well thought pass this point.

Our developers established before project release, our Safe name will transpire as the foundation of our business ethics and not promising quick rich schemes, but insuring a long-term stability and profits.

SafeGalaxy was born with one thing in mind &gt; The token must have a utility and a use case to avoid the end game of just building a token on hypenomics but actual tokenomics.

Our projection is to carry SafeGalaxy as part of our business’s ecosystem named 'Galaxy Protocol’ to a soon to be launched decentralised exchange named Galaxy Swap.

GalaxySwap will be launched with the ability to stake or farm SafeGalaxy to earn our new stable token Galaxia.

Galaxia is set to be the stable coin of our ecosystem. SafeGalaxy becomes the farming and staking pair of Galaxia. Galaxia will push further in its own tokenomics to be a much more far-reaching token to compete and be valued to real world values, only to increase its value as the token expands.

Essentially investing in SafeGalaxy now, will prepare you for the launch of the decentralised exchange Galaxy Swap. Beginning the journey of the birth of Galaxia, as one investment is rewarded with another.

Our investors are investing in a project and business and not on *hypenomics*. We build on the belief of our investors to profit as our investors believe in the growth of our business.

Once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $10 each. The villagers, seeing that there were many monkeys around, went out to the forest and started catching them.

The man bought thousands at $10 and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. He further announced that he would now buy at $20. This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again.

Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch it!

The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on behalf of him.

In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers ""Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected. I will sell them to you at $35 and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each.""

The villagers rounded up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys. They never saw the man nor his assistant again, only monkeys everywhere!

CryptoCurrency,"The Rise Of One, To Give Birth To Another. Hypenomics vs Tokenomics","We find the name ‘Safe’ to be synonyms on every corner of our crypto space. The generated interest of one successful safe token has led to many others trying to outdo each other in this bubble of *hypenomics*, which will eventually burst. 

*Hypenomics – A token which has no use case or utility but only growing its price through hype.*

The general misconception of many is 'wen lambo' 'wen moon' and so forth. The mindset of many who invest in *hypenomics*; is the get rich quick psychology, forced into your minds of what crypto currency is truly all about. 

The very reason of *hypenomics* was the opportunity to divide and separate from this endless endeavour has been the very fundamentals of our developers. The labelling of our token, to be put into the same basket as the rest of the eggs before launch, was well thought pass this point. 

Our developers established before project release, our Safe name will transpire as the foundation of our business ethics and not promising quick rich schemes, but insuring a long-term stability and profits.

SafeGalaxy was born with one thing in mind &gt; The token must have a utility and a use case to avoid the end game of just building a token on hypenomics but actual tokenomics. 

Our projection is to carry SafeGalaxy as part of our business’s ecosystem named 'Galaxy Protocol’ to a soon to be launched decentralised exchange named Galaxy Swap.

GalaxySwap will be launched with the ability to stake or farm SafeGalaxy to earn our new stable token Galaxia. 

Galaxia is set to be the stable coin of our ecosystem. SafeGalaxy becomes the farming and staking pair of Galaxia. Galaxia will push further in its own tokenomics to be a much more far-reaching token to compete and be valued to real world values, only to increase its value as the token expands. 

Essentially investing in SafeGalaxy now, will prepare you for the launch of the decentralised exchange Galaxy Swap. Beginning the journey of the birth of Galaxia, as one investment is rewarded with another.

Our investors are investing in a project and business and not on *hypenomics*. We build on the belief of our investors to profit as our investors believe in the growth of our business.

Hello Binance Team,

\[Binance\] Compensation Claim Rejected

Your USDⓈ-M Futures compensation claim with Appeal ID 202105191930016866718604895 is rejected.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear user, Thank you for the information and description provided. Upon verification of the orders and the activity in your account,  

we can see that upon opening the short position on the date and time 2021-05-19 12:56:00 (UTC) which is when the limit sell order was filled,

\- I opened the buy order at the start of 12:54 to 12:55:0? And the price was above the set price but I got network failure on android as shown (it may open the order but didn't show, your server is buggy and failing at the time) and used PC as I got errors viewing and controlling the trade (network failed) but the price marker is moving! -

&amp;#x200B;

You have placed 2 take profit market orders. One was placed on the date and time 2021-05-19 12:55:56 (UTC)

\- was take profit placed by default or manually after my filled sell order? -

&amp;#x200B;

And was subsequently manually canceled on your end on the date and time 2021-05-19 12:56:05 (UTC). The other was placed on the date a time 2021-05-19 12:56:33 (UTC) with the stop price at 32500 USDta nd trigger condition mark price which was expired on the date and time 2021-05-19 12:57:43 (UTC) due to the correct execution of the stop-market order with trigger condition mark price and stop price 33800 USDT executing correctly on the date and time 2021-05-19 12:57:43 (UTC).  

\- are you aware of your android bug where TP/SL not being posted properly after double ticking, even reduce only being posted with orders after double ticking it out : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xr\_4FUZ2DZUej8b9bhQpA-wyMduldRF1/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xr_4FUZ2DZUej8b9bhQpA-wyMduldRF1/view?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

And the closing of this trade was executed based on an order placed from your usual IP and device. At the moment, under these circumstances, we cannot provide financial compensation of some kind. Thank you for your understanding, Sincerely. Binance Support

I have gathered more evidence and will repost the compensation properly to understand the errors from binance platform causing this loss when I was supposed to profit $33000 extra if it performed as it should,

 

At start I have placed sell order of 33000 with TP on 32000 and SL 33800 (on android with double ticking the options while deciding and TP/SL instructions didn't go through) 12:54 to 12:55:0? (even with delay your system pick it up upon later checking on 12:55:14 where the opening price 33250.00 , low 32286.68 but didn't get filled till 12:56:00 as per your communication where the opening was 32909.50)

I sat stop market from my PC and my android without reduce at 33800 and it didn't get picked up magically and the highest point of that minute got picked up of 35000!!! Causing -$77000 instead of -24000!

I think we're in a bit of a dead cat bounce right now. After seeing the SNL skit and Doge's behavior during it I was expecting at the very least a correction but was far from surprised by the crash we're experiencing. That price movement could not have indicated an overhyped/overheated market anymore clearly. I know we now have nice gains for the past 24 hours but imo it's simply too soon for another run. I think too much capital was expended on the way up from January to the present, both from the small fish and the whales.

  


I know we've experienced big corrections followed by further bull runs in the past, but looking at real life factors I don't think that will be the case this time. First world countries are coming out of lockdown, prices are going up, and I think people are going to start needing the money they put into crypto.

  


Last thing I'm considering right now is the potential for a black swan type event in the stock market. At this point in cryptos lifetime, I think a stock market crash will absolutely drag crypto down with it. Especially if crypto continues to be down significantly from it's ATH for the next few months. I freely admit that this is a theory that I am far from being sure of, but my simple idea behind it is that the extreme recovery from the march 2020 crash just kicked the can down the road (and maybe made it worse when we finally deal with it). If this theory does end up playing out I think we'll see another crypto winter as the stock market slowly recovers, at this point I would expect crypto to be down until the next BTC halving ~2024. Although in a dream world we would perhaps see ETH take off before then, taking the \#1 spot from BTC and carrying the crypto market to a quicker recovery. That would be very nice to see lol.

Especially if crypto continues to be down significantly from it's ATH for the next few months. I freely admit that this is a theory that I am far from being sure of, but my simple idea behind it is that the extreme recovery from the march 2020 crash just kicked the can down the road (and maybe made it worse when we finally deal with it). If this theory does end up playing out I think we'll see another crypto winter as the stock market slowly recovers, at this point I would expect crypto to be down until the next BTC halving ~2024. Although in a dream world we would perhaps see ETH take off before then, taking the \#1 spot from BTC and carrying the crypto market to a quicker recovery. That would be very nice to see lol.

These aren't orders for little amounts but e.g. 17,000 coins, 60034.5 coins and more around 16,000.

By selling and buying the same amounts allows a malicious trader (acting under different accounts) to artificially boost volume making it look more active than it really is.

Of course, this is outlawed in the real markets and proving it is always difficult though but in an unregulated market, all's fair play.

CryptoCurrency,"If BTC Reached Its ATH of 70k Several Months Out, What's the Likelihood it Would Blow to 100k or More?","So, like a lot of people, I'm elbow deep in it right now and that's exciting and stressful all at once because what was once small play money has now blossomed into a substantial amount.   I know we may very well be at the beginning of the bear cycle, but for the sake of argument, let's say by August or September Bitcoin goes past its former ATH and reaches 70k. 

What is the likelihood, then, that we'll see a mania up to 100k or more?  I mean, is it likely we would see some correction before a blowout of 100k or would it shoot up to 100k from there, or if it does correct is it likely that that is it's ATH and it will correct about 80 percent from there?

I know no one really knows for sure, but I'd love to get your opinion on it because I'm currently trying to figure out the bare minimum I would be willing to sell.   I plan to sell a little bit on the ride up, but it would be nice to have a good idea of what to expect if this final bull run occurs.  My estimate right now is that BTC won't go much higher than 100k.  Maybe 130k.  But reading testimonies from the previous bullruns, a lot of people suggest that it could easily get to 170k and even blow past that, which to me seems too fantastical to be even remotely possible. 

Anyway love to hear your thoughts on what you realistically see this go to because I'm sure you're well aware, there's just too much bullshit out there.  Like, some people are even saying it'll go to 300-400k and ADA will blast to 15 dollars and Vechain 5 dollars!  But, just looking at the facts and their market caps and previous data...Yeah, that's just total bullshit.  However, 100-170k for BTC, 5-10 dollars for ADA, and .60-$1 for VET doesn't seem too unreasonable, but I'm wondering if even those numbers are too much and that I should expect lower numbers?",1621875769,"If BTC Reached Its ATH of 70k Several Months Out, What's the Likelihood it Would Blow to 100k or More?So, like a lot of people, I'm elbow deep in it right now and that's exciting and stressful all at once because what was once small play money has now blossomed into a substantial amount.

So I remembered seeing Ethereum go down by huge numbers, then go up again like it didnt happen. Except I sold all my Eth when it went down the first few times.
